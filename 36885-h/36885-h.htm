<h2>RHEIMS</h2>

<h3>POLITICAL HISTORY</h3>


<p>Rheims is one of the oldest towns in France, so old that legendary accounts,
in an endeavour to outdo one another, carry back its foundation sometimes
to 1440 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> after the Flood, sometimes to the siege of Troy. Lying at the
intersection of the natural routes between Belgium and Burgundy, and between
the Parisian basin and Lorraine, <i>i.e.</i> between political districts that long
remained different in character, and regions having different commercial
resources, it was at one and the same time the "<i>oppidum</i>" and <i>market-town</i>.
Its military and commercial position destined it early to be a great city.</p>

<p>It probably takes its name from the tribe of the <i>Remi</i>, who occupied
almost the whole territory now forming the "<i>départements</i>" of the Marne
and the Ardennes, and who were clients of the <i>Suessiones</i> (Soissons) before
the Roman conquest. It was already a prosperous town, under the name of
"<i>Durocortorum</i>," when Cæsar conquered Gaul. It freed itself from the
yoke of the Suessiones by accepting the Roman domination. When the
Belgians revolted in 57 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the <i>Remi</i> remained faithful to Cæsar and received
the title of "<i>friends of the Roman people</i>." Neither did they take any part
in the general revolt of Gaul in 52 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Under the Empire, Rheims was,
with Trèves, one of the great centres of Latin culture in "<i>Gallia Belgica</i>."
On becoming a federated city, it retained its institutions and senate. A
favourite residence of the Roman Governors, Rheims was embellished with
sumptuous villas and magnificent monuments, and soon became one of the
most prosperous towns in Gaul. At the beginning of the Germanic invasions
Rheims drew in its borders and became a military town. Under <i>Diocletian</i>
it was the capital of <i>Belgica Secunda</i>.</p>

<p>According to tradition, Christianity was first preached in Rheims by
St. Sixtus and St. Sinirus, the first bishops of the city. However that may be,
Christianity was firmly established there as early as the 3rd century. A
bishop of Rheims was present at the Council of Arles in 314. The conversion
of several great Roman personages (amongst others, the <i>Consul Jovinus</i>&mdash;see
p. <a href="#Page_118">118</a>) favoured the progress of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>In the 5th century, when Rome, otherwise occupied, was unable to hold
back the barbarians, invasions interfered with the development of the city.
The Frankish conquest marked the beginning of a new period of prosperity.
In 486, after the victory of Soissons, <i>Clovis</i> entered into negotiations with
St. Remi, who, at the age of 22, had been elected Bishop of Rheims in 459,
and whose long episcopate of seventy-four years is probably unique in history.
On Christmas Day, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 496, St. Remi, who had arranged the marriage of Clovis
with the Christian princess Clotilde, baptized the Frankish king with his
own hands in the Cathedral. This important event took place undoubtedly
at Rheims and not at Tours, as a learned German, <i>Krusch</i>, has attempted
to prove.</p>

<p>Under the Merovingians and Carolingians, the history of Rheims became
merged in that of the French monarchy. The possession of the city was
disputed as fiercely as that of the throne. The city was mixed up in quarrels
from which it suffered, without, however, losing its religious prestige. Pépin-le-Bref
and Pope Stephen III., Charlemagne and Pope Leo III. had famous
interviews there. When the Carolingians restored the religious hierarchy
Rheims became one of the twenty-two chief cities of the Empire. From the
time of Charlemagne, the Archbishop of Rheims ruled over twelve bishoprics,
comprising the cities of the ancient Roman province of <i>Belgica Secunda</i>.</p>

<p>From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> the 9th to the 11th century the history of Rheims is that of its
church. The Counts of Vermandois, the Lords of Coucy and the archbishops
first disputed, then divided its temporal possession, the latter falling eventually
to the archbishops in the 11th century. After becoming Counts, with
the right to coin money, and, from 940, powerful temporal princes, the
archbishops played a great political part in the struggles between the
Carolingian princes. Under <i>Charles-le-Chauve</i>, Archbishop Hincmar became
the protector of the enfeebled monarchy. In 858 he prevented <i>Louis-le-Germanique</i>
from deposing his nephew and becoming King of France. In
987, Archbishop Adalbéron, at the Meeting of Senlis, drove the legitimate
heir, <i>Charles de Lorraine</i>, from the throne, and favoured the election of
Hughes Capet. Although, under the Capetians, Paris became the political
capital of France, Rheims became the religious metropolis of the kingdom.
From the time when <i>Louis-le-Pieux</i> had himself consecrated emperor in the
Cathedral, by Pope Stephen IV., it was understood that every new king
must be consecrated by the successor of St. Remi.</p>


<h4>The Consecration of the Kings of France</h4>

<p>In the 12th century, Popes and Kings formally acknowledged the right
of the Archbishop of Rheims to consecrate and crown the kings of France.
As a matter of fact, until the Revolution, all the kings, except Louis IV.
and Henri IV., were consecrated at Rheims.</p>

<p>The ceremony of consecration filled the Cathedral with a great crowd of
people. Apart from the peers, numerous prelates, dignitaries of the Kingdom,
the Court, the Chapter of the Cathedral and the populace crowded in. Staging
was erected for the public in the transept ends and along the choir. Before
the consecration took place, the archbishop, at the head of a procession,
went to receive the <i>Sacred Ampulla</i> at the threshold of the Cathedral, brought
on horseback by the Abbot of St. Remi. Returning to the altar, the prelate
received the King's oath and then consecrated him, anointing him with the
holy oil on his head and breast, between and on his shoulders, on the joints
of his arms and in the palms of his hands, each motion being accompanied
with a special prayer. Then the Peers handed the insignia of royalty to the
archbishop, who, surrounded by all the Peers, placed the crown of Charlemagne
on the head of the King, <i>while the people shouted</i> "<i>Long live the King</i>."</p>

<p>The King was then led to a throne prepared for him at the entrance to
the Choir, and mass was celebrated with great pomp. The King and Queen
communicated in both kinds, and the royal party then went in procession
to the archbishop's palace, where the <i>Feast of Consecration</i> was held.</p>

<p>In 1162, the Archbishopric of Rheims, until then a county, became a
Duchy and the highest peerage in France, which explains why it was given
to great personages, such as Henri-de-France and Guillaume-de-Champagne,
brother and brother-in-law of Louis VII.</p>

<p>In the 12th century the archbishops, freed from the feudal rivalries,
were confronted by a new power, the <i>bourgeoisie</i> or middle classes, born of
the progress of industry and commerce, and whose importance was demonstrated
by the great Champagne Fairs held sometimes at Rheims and sometimes
at Troyes. The first <i>Company of Burgesses</i>, founded in 1138, soon
became a "<i>Commune</i>." In 1147, the suburb of St. Remi, which the archbishop
refused to allow to become attached to the "<i>Commune</i>" rose in revolt
and was only appeased by the intervention of St. Bernard and Suger.</p>

<p>In 1160, Archbishop Henri-de-France, with the help of the Count of
Flanders, who was occupying Rheims with a thousand horsemen, suppressed
the "<i>Commune</i>" whose independence was alarming him. In 1182 a royal
charter, granting to the inhabitants the right to elect for a year twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"<i>échevins</i>" (aldermen), re-established the <i>Commune</i> in fact, if not in name,
but the struggle between the <i>Commune</i> and the archbishop still went on.
In 1211, Philippe-Auguste compelled the aldermen to hand over the keys of
the city gates to the archbishop.</p>

<span class="caption">THE CONSECRATION CEREMONY OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE IN THE

</div>

<p>In 1228, Archbishop Henri-de-Braine, not feeling himself safe in the city,
built the fortified castle of Mars-Gate (or old castle of the archbishops)
outside the walls, but looking towards the city (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a></i>). During the
serious riots of 1235, the burgesses besieged the archbishop's castle, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
act they were excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX., and rebuked by
St. Louis. In 1257, St. Louis intervened once more, to put an end to the
fighting between the free Companies of the Burghers and the soldiers of
the archbishop.</p>

<p>In the 14th century the two adversaries frequently came to blows, until
the king, in 1362, put an end to their quarrels by taking into his own
hands the care and military government of Rheims.</p>

<p>In spite of these local struggles the city developed in the course of the
Middle Ages. With Chartres it had a well-attended episcopal school, long
before Paris. Among the masters of this school were <i>Gerbert</i>, one of the
most learned men of the Middle Ages, who became Pope under the name of
Sylvester II., and <i>St. Bruno</i>, founder of the Carthusian Order. Among the
pupils were <i>Fulbert</i> (afterwards Bishop of Chartres), the historian <i>Richer</i>,
<i>Guillaume de Champeaux</i>, and <i>Abélard</i> (adversary of St. Bernard).</p>

<p>During the Hundred Years' War (<i>see military section</i>) the Town Council
of Rheims, which the Treaty of Troyes in 1420 had placed under the domination
of the English, declared in favour of Charles VII., in spite of the Duke of
Burgundy, who was residing at Laon, and notwithstanding the intrigues
of the Bishop of Beauvais, Pierre Cauchon, who, profiting by the absence
of the archbishop, went so far as to have a <i>Corpus Christi</i> procession in the
city, to call down the blessing of Heaven upon the English. On July 17th,
1429, Joan-of-Arc handed over the keys of the city to the king, and was
present at the consecration, standing near the altar with her standard which,
"after having been through much tribulation, was accounted worthy of a
place of honour." Since the return of Charles VII. to Rheims, the city had
never ceased to be French. After the departure of the king and Joan-of-Arc,
a friend of Pierre Cauchon plotted to deliver the town into the hands
of the Duke of Burgundy, to whom the English promised it, provided he could
take it. The plot was discovered and failed.</p>

<p>Under Louis XI. a serious revolt, known as the Micquemaque, broke out
in the town. Louis, well received at the time of his consecration, had promised
the people of Rheims (or so they believed) the abolition of the tax known as
the "<i>taille.</i>" When, therefore, in the following year, the collectors demanded
payment, the people rose in revolt and drove them out.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />THE OLD CASTLE OF THE ARCHBISHOPS OF RHEIMS,
RAZED TO THE GROUND BY HENRI IV.<br />
<i>The Archbishops of Rheims were formerly powerful temporal
lords (see page <a href="#Page_4">4</a>).</i></span>
</div>

<p>As usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> the king had recourse to treachery. Disguised as peasants, his
soldiers entered the city unperceived. Once inside, they arrested those who
were most deeply compromised, and carried out violent reprisals. Houses
were plundered, many of the inhabitants banished, and nine put to death.</p>

<p>During the War of Religion, Rheims sided with the Catholics.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the <i>Guises</i>, five of whom were archbishops of Rheims
(notably Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, the protector of Rabelais and Ronsard,
and founder of the University of Rheims in 1547), the town espoused the cause
of the League and opened its gates to the Duc de Mayenne in 1585. It submitted
to Henri IV. only after the battle of Ivry, when the Castle of Mars
Gate (stronghold of the archbishops) was razed to the ground. Henceforth
the archbishops played no political part, and Richelieu put an end to strife
by turning the <i>Guises</i> out of the archi-episcopal see.</p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries the town lived in peace, with alternations
of misery and suffering (caused by plague or famine) and commercial and
industrial prosperity. It was at Rheims that the first French newspaper,
the "Gazette de France," printed by Godard in 1694, appeared.</p>

<p>During the Revolution, Rheims received the new ideas with enthusiasm.
It furnished a great number of volunteers to withstand the invasion, and on
August 14th, 1792, the Legislative Assembly proclaimed that the city "<i>had
deserved well of the country</i>."</p>

<p>Under the Restoration its industry developed. In August, 1830, the
people, who were favourably to the Revolution of July, overturned the cross
of the "<i>Calvaire de la Mission</i>," erected in 1821 by the ultra-Catholic party,
and in its place set up a funeral urn with the inscription, "To the brave men
who died for liberty on the 27th, 28th and 29th days of July, 1830." The
population accepted the monarchy of July, but without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Second Empire witnessed a remarkable development of business
activity which, after the momentary stoppage caused by the War of 1870
and the Prussian occupation (<i>see military section</i>), made of Rheims, at the end
of the 19th century, one of the great commercial and industrial cities of
France. The population increased from about 30,000 (in 1792) to 59,000 (in
1865) and to more than 115,000 in 1912.</p>

<p>When the War of 1914 broke out, the rich and ancient city was still as
<i>La Fontaine</i> had described it:</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>No town is dearer to me than Rheims,<br />

<h3>MILITARY HISTORY</h3>


<p>If the military and commercial situation of Rheims destined it, from early
times, to be a great city, it also exposed it to the greed of ambitious foreigners,
and opened the road to invasion.</p>

<p>During the Hundred Years' War the city was fiercely disputed. On
December 4th, 1359, Edward III. of England besieged it. On January 11th,
1360, a sortie of the troops and burghers, under Remi Grammaire, compelled
him to raise the siege, in recognition of which feat of arms Charles V. permitted
the "<i>fleur-de-lys</i>" (emblem of the Royal House of France) to be
emblazoned on the City's coat of arms. Since then the Shield of Rheims
has been: In chief France ancient, in base argent Two, laurel branches in
Saltire vert. In 1420 the English were more successful and entered Rheims,
whose gates were opened to them by Philippe-le-Bon, Duke of Burgundy.
Nine years later (July 16th, 1429) the Dauphin of France and Joan-of-Arc
entered the town, then finally delivered, by the Dieu-Lumière Gate (formerly
the Gate of St. Nicaise).</p>

<p>During the invasion of 1814, Marshal Marmont's troops retook Rheims
on March 13th, after sharp street fighting, and Napoleon entered the city
the same night.</p>

<p>In 1870, after the investment of Metz, Rheims witnessed the departure
of the army formed by MacMahon at Châlons-sur-Marne, for the relief of
Marshal Bazaine. A few days later (September 4th) the Prussian troops
entered the city at 3 o'clock in the afternoon by three different gates. On
the 6th, the King of Prussia, accompanied by Bismarck and Von Moltke,
made an imposing entry, and resided for some time at the archi-episcopal
palace, in the apartments reserved for the Kings of France at the time of their
consecration. Rheims was held to ransom, and a number of citizens shot
for protesting against the German yoke, chief among whom was the Abbé
Miroy, Curé of Cuchery, whose tomb (the work of the sculptor Saint Marceaux)
is in the northern cemetery. Others were carried away prisoners to Germany.
The Prussian troops evacuated the town on November 20th, 1872.</p>


<h4>The Invasion of 1914</h4>

<h6>(<i>See map, p. <a href="#Page_11">11</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>Forty-four years later to a day (September 4, 1914), German advance
troops again entered Rheims, as General Joffre's plans had not provided for
defending the city. However, the Army detachments placed under the command
of General Foch on August 29, and wedged in between the 4th and
5th Armies, stayed the German advance for a few days. On August 30 the
42nd Division from the East, detrained at Rheims and took up positions at
Sault-Saint-Rémy and Saint-Loup-en-Champagne on August 31, to the left
of the 9th and 11th Corps.</p>

<p>On September 1, General Foch resisted on the river Retourne but, in the
evening, withdrew to the river Suippe, in conformity with the general orders.
On the 2nd the town was still protected by the 10th Corps (elements of which
occupied the Fort of St. Thierry), by the 42nd Division near Brimont and to
the north of the Aviation ground, and by the 9th and 11th Corps to the
east. On the 3rd, the French retreat towards the Marne became more rapid,
and Rheims was abandoned. On September 5, Prince August Wilhelm
of Prussia entered the town and took up his quarters at the Grand Hôtel.
The Germans at once requisitioned 50 tons of meat, 20 tons of vegetables,
100 tons of bread, 50 tons of oats, 15,000 gallons of petrol, besides straw
and hay, and insisted on the immediate payment of a million francs as a
guarantee that their requirements would be met.</p>

</div>

<p>This sum was paid in the course of the afternoon, under threats by the
enemy. From the 6th onwards the German soldiers gave themselves up to
plundering. The tobacco warehouse at 21 Rue Payen was ransacked,
and more than 700,000 francs worth of cigars and tobacco stolen. On
the following days pillaging, especially of the food-shops, continued. On
the 9th, the Kommandantur requisitioned civilians to bury the dead in the
Rethel, Epernay and Montmirail districts. On the 11th, the Crown Prince
arrived and took up his quarters at the Grand Hôtel, where he was joined by
Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of the Kaiser. On the morning of the 12th,
the Germans, alarmed at the approach of the victorious French troops from
the Marne, arrested the Mayor (Dr. Langlet), Mgr. Neveux, coadjutor of
Rheims, and the Abbé Camus. They then drew up a list of a hundred hostages
and threatened to hang them at the first attempt at disorder. They
also threatened to burn the city, wholly or partially, and to hang the inhabitants,
if any of them molested the German soldiers. All that day the Germans,
instead of organising defences, left the town in haste, after first pillaging it.
In the afternoon the Crown Prince left the Grand Hôtel with his suite. At
5 p.m., after setting fire to the forage stores, the Kommandantur left Rheims
by the Rethel road in drenching rain, followed by the hundred hostages,
who were only released at the level-crossing at Witry-les-Reims. When
the latter returned to Rheims, a patrol of French mounted Chasseurs had
already entered the town by the suburb of St. Anne. The next morning,
at about 6 o'clock, the French troops, with the 6th mounted Chasseurs at
their head, entered Rheims by the Rue de Vesle. At 1 p.m. General Franchet
d'Espérey, commanding the French 5th Army, entered the city.</p>


<h4>The Battles for Rheims, 1914-1918</h4>

<p>Although evacuated by the Germans, Rheims had yet to remain for
nearly four years under enemy fire. With equal obstinacy the adversaries
disputed the town, the French seeking to disengage it and the Germans
to recapture it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>On September 12, on the approach of the victorious French Army from
the Marne, the Germans entrenched themselves to the south-west of the town,
and established a line of resistance passing through Thillois, Ormes, Bezannes
and Villers-aux-Noeuds.</p>

<p>In spite of the very unfavourable weather, the 3rd Corps (Gen.
Hache) vigorously engaged the enemy at Thillois, and forced them to
abandon the position in the evening. The 1st Corps (Gen. Deligny),
on the right, had orders to push forward advance-guards into Rheims,
but as a matter of fact they reached the suburb of Vesle. The 10th
Corps (Gen. Defforges) attacked at Puisieulx and forced the enemy across
the Vesle.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the left of the 3rd Corps arrived in front of Courcy and Brimont,
where the Germans were strongly entrenched. A desperate battle took
place, with the result that Courcy was taken before noon. Loivre likewise
fell into the hands of the French, but the passage of the Aisne Canal was
fiercely disputed. The attack on Brimont failed, in spite of the great valour
of the troops, who sustained heavy losses. Meanwhile, the 1st Corps crossed
Rheims, with orders to debouch at Bétheny. Just outside the town
they were met with violent artillery fire, which, however, did not completely
check their advance. La Neuvillette, Pierquin Farm and Bétheny
were occupied, and the 1st Corps linked up on its left with the 3rd Corps,
on the outskirts of Soulain Woods. The advance continued during the
night, and Modelin Farm was reached by advance-guards. General
Deligny took up his headquarters in the suburb of Vesle. The 10th
Corps crossed the Vesle, engaged the enemy at St. Léonard and reached
the railway.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the fighting greatly increased in violence. The 3rd
Corps, in spite of repeated efforts, was unable to advance; on the left it
failed to drive the enemy from the St. Marie Farm, while on the right
it was held up before Brimont. The 1st Corps was likewise checked; the
1st Division (Gen. Gallet) attempted unsuccessfully to support General
Hache in his attack on Brimont. The 10th Corps, although strongly
engaged towards the Fort of La Pompelle, made but little progress.
Farther away, on the right, the battle extended along the front of the
9th Army.</p>

<p>On the 15th, at 5.30 a.m., the 5th Army resumed a general offensive.
Fierce fighting took place at St. Marie Farm, to the left of the 3rd Corps,
and also further north, near Hill 100. Despite heavy sacrifices, however,
the enemy held their positions; but, on the right, the 36th Infantry Regiment
captured the Château of Brimont at day-break. General Deligny, less
fortunate, was driven out of Soulains Woods, but stood firm at the Champ-de-Courses
and Bétheny. The 10th Corps continued to advance slowly,
and at certain points reached the high-road to Suippes.</p>

<p>On the 16th, the 3rd Corps attacked Brimont again, but failed. At the
château the situation became more and more critical, by reason of the
retreat of the 1st Corps on the previous day. This Corps had again to face
a powerful enemy counter-offensive, which, however, failed to drive it from
the Modelin Farm and the "Cavaliers de Courcy."</p>

<p>On the 17th, the Germans counter-attacked all along the line. In the
afternoon the 3rd Corps, which stood firm at Godat Farm and Loivre, was
elsewhere compelled to cross to the west bank of the canal and fall back on
Courcy.</p>

<p>After a heroic defence the isolated garrison of Brimont Castle, weakened
by heavy losses, surrendered during the night, after having spent all its
ammunition. The 1st Corps, the greater part of which had left for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
region of Berry-au-Bac, held its positions with its last available units. The
10th Corps extended its front westwards to Bétheny, while one of its regiments,
the 2nd Infantry, occupied La Pompelle Fort.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the enemy increased their efforts against the front held by
the 3rd Corps and the reserve units further west. Loivre, which had so
far resisted, fell. The French withdrew to the west of the road to Laon.
The situation was considered critical at this point of the front. The 10th
Corps, which had been withdrawn from the east of Rheims, in favour of
another sector, was stopped on the way and sent for a few days in support
of the 3rd Corps.</p>

<p>On the 19th, one of its brigades counter-attacked Courcy Mill. On the
other side, the Moroccan Division (Gen. Humbert), which had relieved the
10th Corps, continued to hold La Pompelle Fort.</p>

<p>Gradually the front became fixed. Desperate, indecisive fighting still
took place, but finally the front stabilised on the line extending from the
foot of the Berru and Nogent-l'Abbesse Hills, along the road from Rheims
to Suippes, on the east, and along the western bank of the Aisne Canal on the
north.</p>

<h4>The French Offensive of April, 1917</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The French offensive, planned by the then Commander-in-Chief, General
Nivelle, and launched in April, between Soissons and Auberive, aimed at
piercing the German front and disengaging Rheims.</p>

<p>North-west of Rheims was the 5th Army (Gen. Mazel), of which the
38th Corps (Gen. de Mondesir) held the immediate approaches to the town,
followed by the 7th Corps (Gen. de Bazelaire), 32nd Corps (Gen. Passaga)
astride the Aisne, and, extending beyond Craonne, the 5th Corps (Gen. de
Boissoudy) and the 1st Corps (Gen. Muteau).</p>

<p>East of Rheims the 4th Army (Gen. Anthoine) was engaged only during
the second stage of the battle.</p>

<p>At 6 a.m. on the 16th, in drenching rain, the 5th Army attacked all
along the front, in conjunction on the left with the 6th Army (Gen. Mangin),
which undertook to storm the Chemin-des-Dames. The enemy was expecting
the attack, and had concentrated very large forces and powerful artillery.
Despite their bravery, the French were unable to break through.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i016.png" width="700" height="342" alt="EXPLANATORY MAP OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN 1917" title="" />
<span class="caption">EXPLANATORY MAP OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN 1917</span>
</div>

<p>In the Rheims sector, the 32nd Corps advanced three kilometers to the
north of the Aisne. The 7th Corps crossed the canal at Loivre and captured
Berméricourt in the morning, but was forced to give up part of the conquered
ground in the afternoon, in consequence of a powerful German counter-attack.
In front of Brimont a brigade of the 38th Corps failed to pierce the
enemy's positions.</p>

<p>On the 17th, while the army of General Mazel resisted a violent enemy
counter-attack, General Anthoine attacked from the east of Rheims to Auberive
with the 8th Corps (Gen. Hély d'Oissel), 17th Corps (Gen. J. B. Dumas),
12th Corps (Gen. Nourrisson). At 4.45 a.m., despite violent squalls of rain
and snow, the French infantry rushed forward and carried the first German
lines along a front of eleven kilometers. The 34th Division (Gen. de Lobit)
carried the Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond hills, which the enemy attempted
in vain to recapture.</p>

<p>On April 18 and 19, and May 4 and 5, the fighting was spasmodic and
finally ceased. On the whole, the French offensive failed, and Rheims
continued to remain under enemy gun-fire.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 27, 1918, the Germans commenced a powerful
offensive between Vauxaillon (on the Chemin-des-Dames) and the Fort of
Brimont. At the beginning of the attack, the French line passed through
Bétheny and along the Aisne-Marne Canal. In the evening, after the loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the Chemin-des-Dames and the Aisne Canal, Rheims was no longer protected
on the north-west, except by the St. Thierry Heights, which were soon
turned. The Germans crossed the Vesle at several points, principally at
Bazoches and Fismes, and advanced as far as Muizon.</p>

<p>On May 29, the French line passed through La Neuvillette, Châlons-sur-Vesle,
Muizon and Rosnay. On the 30th, it extended from Perquin
Farm to Méry-Premecy, via Champigny. On the 31st, Tinqueux and Vrigny
fell.</p>

<p>Further to the south the Germans advanced along the valley of the Ardre
towards the Château-Thierry&mdash;Epernay&mdash;Châlons railway, threatening
Epernay (<i>see the Michelin Guide: "The Second Battle of the Marne"</i>).</p>

<p>However, Rheims still held out. On June 1, the Germans attacked
simultaneously, without success, to the south-east of the town (between
Pommery Park and La Pompelle Fort), and on the west and south-west
(between La Haubette and Ormes), while the French recaptured Vrigny.
On three separate occasions&mdash;in the evening of the 1st, and on June 9 and
18, the enemy's powerful and costly efforts to recapture this important
position broke down. On the 18th, they delivered a fresh general attack
from Vrigny to La Pompelle, gaining a footing in the Northern Cemetery of
Rheims and in the north-eastern outskirts of Sillery, but everywhere else
they were repulsed. On the 23rd and 29th, they rushed Bligny Hill, held by
the Italians, only to lose it again shortly afterwards. Once again, Rheims
had eluded the enemy's grasp.</p>


<h4>July 15 to August 9, 1918</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i017.png" width="700" height="546" alt="EXPLANATORY MAP OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE" title="" />
<span class="caption">EXPLANATORY MAP OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE</span>
</div>

<p>At dawn, on July 15, the Germans began a new offensive from Château-Thierry
to La Main de Massiges. It was Ludendorf's much vaunted "Friedensturm"
(peace-battle), and was expected by him to prove irresistible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
decisive. Its purpose was to complete the encirclement of Rheims,
carry the hills surrounding the town, crush the French 4th Army,
and reach Châlons-sur-Marne (<i>see the Michelin Guide: "Champagne and
Argonne"</i>). However, this time, there was no surprise, and the Allies held
out victoriously.</p>

<p>To the west, between Dormans and Rheims, Franco-Italian forces held
their ground on the Châtillon-sur-Marne&mdash;Cuchery&mdash;Marfaux&mdash;Bouilly line.
To the east, from La Pompelle to the Argonne, the army of General Gouraud,
after voluntarily abandoning its first line previous to the enemy's attack,
checked and decimated the armies of Von Einem and Von Mudra, on its
second or battle-line. On July 16, 17 and 18, the enemy, now exhausted
and incapable of resuming their general attack, attempted local attempts
only, especially near Beaumont-sur-Vesle, to the north of Prosnes, and in the
region of Trigny and Pourcy, to the west, all of which were repulsed. Once
more Rheims escaped, and was destined from now on, to be gradually freed
from the enemy's grasp. The French counter-offensive began on July 18,
on the Aisne (<i>see the Michelin Guide: "The Second Battle of the Marne"</i>),
extending shortly afterwards to the west of Rheims. On the 22nd, the army
of General Berthelot captured St. Euphraise and Bouilly, and on the 23rd
reached a point between Vrigny and the Ardre. A number of German
counter-attacks on July 24, 25 and 30 and August 1 failed to check
its advance. On August 2, Gueux and Thillois were recaptured. On
the 4th, the Vesle was reached to the east of Fismes, and the latter occupied,
while a small force crossed to the north bank of the river. On the 7th, after
fierce fighting, in which the French and Americans advanced foot by foot,
the Vesle was crossed to the east of Bazoches and Braine. On the 9th,
Fismette was taken.</p>


<h4>September 26 to November 11, 1918</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i018.png" width="700" height="449" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The disengaging of Rheims, which had begun slowly, was now rapidly
accomplished. Two French offensives completely effected it in a few days&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of September 26 (<i>see the Michelin Guide: "Champagne and Argonne"</i>),
under General Gouraud, and that of September 30, first by General Berthelot
and then by General Guillaumat. The first of these offensives, to the east,
brought about the fall of the Moronvilliers Heights, after outflanking them;
the second, to the west, captured the Saint-Thierry Heights, the French troops
crossing the Aisne-Marne Canal from Le Godat to La Neuvillette. This double
man&oelig;uvre forced the Germans, whose communications were threatened, to
beat a hasty retreat on October 5 along a twenty-seven mile front. An
important part of the old German front of 1914, and one of the most fiercely
disputed, collapsed suddenly. The formidable forts of Brimont and Nogent-l'Abbesse,
which had held Rheims under their guns for four years, fell.
This time the deliverance of Rheims was complete and final.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
The dotted lines show the Allied advance at the date indicated in the middle of each zone
conquered. The line of departure is that of July 18 (18/7). On the evening of Oct. 6 (6/10)&mdash;the
upper thick dotted line&mdash;the town was completely disengaged. The Allied advance has
the appearance of a fan spreading out west of Rheims until Oct. 5 (5/10), when the Germans
were forced to make a deep retreat.
</div>


<h4>The Destruction of Rheims</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>Being unable to capture Rheims, the Germans reduced it to ruins
by bombardment. For four years (September 4, 1914, to October 5,
1918) they rained explosive and incendiary shells on it, almost without
intermission.</p>

<p>On September 3, 1914, at about 11 a.m., a German aeroplane dropped
bombs on the town. A few of the inhabitants left, as the enemy approached,
but the majority remained. A lady-teacher, sixty years of age, Mlle. Fouriaux
(afterwards decorated with the Légion d'Honneur), who had charge of Hospital
No. 101 (formerly a high-school for girls), transferred the wounded to Epernay
and then returned on foot to Rheims.</p>

<p>On September 4, at 9.30 a.m., when the enemy advance-guards were
already in the town, and a German officer was making requisitions at the
Town Hall, the bombardment began again. From 9.30 to 10.15 a.m., 176
large shells fell into the town, three of which tore open the great gallery of
modern paintings in the Museum. Forty-nine civilians were killed and 130
wounded, several of them mortally.</p>

<p>The Germans, hard pressed by the French, evacuated Rheims on September
12. Two days later, at 9 a.m., they bombarded the town. Their fire was
especially directed against the headquarters of General Franchet d'Espérey,
near the Town Hall. On the following days, firing was resumed at the same
hour. On the 17th, the first fires broke out. Many civilians were killed or
wounded. The vicinity of the Cathedral, which was believed to be specially
aimed at, was among the places that suffered most. To protect the Cathedral,
which the Germans had fitted up on the 12th for the reception of their wounded,
some seventy to eighty German wounded were accommodated on straw in
the nave. The Red Cross flag was displayed on each tower, and notice given
to the enemy.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MONT DE PIÉTÉ</span>
</div>

<p>On the 18th, the bombardment began again at 8.15 a.m. In addition
to the Sub-Prefecture, which was almost entirely destroyed, as were also
many important factories, the Cathedral, in spite of the Red Cross flag,
was struck by 8-in. shells, which damaged the outside sculptures of the
lower windows of the main transept, smashing the 13th and 14th century
stained-glass. Splinters of stone killed a French gendarme and two wounded
Germans in the lower part of the south nave.</p>

<p>On the 19th, the bombardment was intensified. The Town Hall, Museum,
hospitals (including that of the Girls' High School), the south side of the
Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace were all hit. Towards noon, incendiary
shells were rained on the centre of the town.</p>

<p>At about 4 p.m., a shell fired the wooden scaffolding round the north-west
tower which had been under repair since 1913. The fire spread quickly
to the roof, the molten lead from which set fire to the straw in the nave.</p>

<p>In spite of a rescue party, who risked their lives in getting out the wounded,
a dozen of the German wounded perished in the flames. The conflagration
spread to the Archbishop's Palace, from which it was impossible to remove
the tapestries or the pre-historic Roman and Gothic collections. The Protestant
Church, the Offices of the Controller of silk and woollen cloths, and
the Colbert barracks along the eastern boulevards were burnt. Everywhere
new centres caught fire, and nearly thirty-five acres of buildings were
destroyed. On the 20th, the bombardment continued with equal violence,
then after a respite of two days began again. Of the Place Royale and the
Rue Colbert nothing remained but a heap of ruins.</p>

<p>On November 1 the number of civilians killed by shell fire had increased
to 282.</p>

<p>From September 14, 1914, to the beginning of June, 1915, the town never
remained more than four days without being shelled. Up to the end of
November, 1914, the shells rarely went beyond the Cathedral and the theatre,
falling mostly in the suburbs of Cérès and Laon. On November 22, the
suburb of Paris was struck, and from that time onwards there was no security
for the inhabitants in any quarter of the city.</p>

<p>As it would take too long to recount all the bombardments, only the most
terrible ones are here mentioned. On November 26, 1914, the German
guns fired all day, one shell alone killing twenty-three patients in the
Hospital for Incurables. On the night of February 21 and on February 22,
1915, more than 1,500 shells fell in the town, killing twenty civilians, setting
on fire a score of houses and piercing the vaulting of the Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 8, terrifying fires broke out again. On April 29 and July 20
more than 500 shells, many of them incendiary, were counted. In April, 1916,
more than 1,200 projectiles struck the different quarters of the town in one
day. On August 13, whilst the town was being bombarded, seven German
aeroplanes dropped incendiary bombs, which burnt the Hôtel Dieu Hospital.
On October 25, the Germans fired more than 600 shells into Rheims and
more than 1,000 on the 27th.</p>

</div>

<p>On April 1, 1917, more than 2,800 shells fell in the town, and on the 4th,
2,121. According to the Official Communiqué, on the night of the 5th and
on Good Friday, the number of shells was 7,500. Easter-Day was likewise
terrible. On April 15, 19 and 24 the town received large numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
8-in., 12-in. and 15-in. shells. On May 3 the Town Hall and 108 houses were
burnt. On the 4th the fires spread to fifteen neighbouring streets.</p>

<p>From April 8 to the 15th the enemy rained incendiary shells on the
town without respite, and completed their work of destruction, in the course
of the afternoon of the 21st, by burning the centre of the town. Hardly anybody
was left in the latter, except the firemen, who, despite their prodigious
activity and valour, were unable to cope with the flames.</p>

<p>Whole streets, often the finest, were burnt down, more than 700 houses
being destroyed.</p>

<p>When, on October 5, the Germans retreated, the havoc caused by this
continual bombardment was incalculable. Of the town's 14,000 houses,
only about sixty were immediately habitable when the people came back.</p>

<p>In addition to the material losses, there were, unfortunately, numerous
irreparable artistic and archæological losses.</p>

<p>Although there were short respites, it may be said that for four years
Rheims led the life of a besieged town, under the fire of the German guns and
howitzers. The enemy increased the calibre of their shells and varied their
modes of bombardment, sometimes firing for a few hours, sometimes all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
long at the rate of one shell every three
minutes, or again at night. Sometimes 3-in.
shells would be used, at others "Jack Johnsons"
of 8-in., 12-in. and 15-in. calibre; sometimes
all four at the same time. Both
explosive and incendiary shells were used,
while aeroplane bombs, darts and asphyxiating
gas were resorted to occasionally.
Public holidays were the occasion of the
fiercest bombardments, in the hope of
increasing the number of victims. For
instance, the shelling was particularly murderous
on All Saints' Day of 1914, when
the eastern and southern cemeteries (generally
crowded on this day) were especially
aimed at. Easter Monday of 1916 and Good
Friday of 1917 were similarly favoured.</p>

<p>After each check&mdash;at Verdun, in Champagne,
on the Somme or wherever it might
be&mdash;the Germans revenged themselves on
Rheims. In this way the Cathedral was
fired by incendiary shells after the defeat on
the Marne in 1914. The awful fires of
February 22 and March 8, 1915, were
the German reply to their set-backs in
Champagne and Argonne. The Hôtel Dieu
hospital was burnt down in August, 1916,
the day after the Franco-British attack on
the Somme. The Town Hall was reduced
to ashes on May 3, 1917, after the
French offensive on the Champagne
hills. For the same reason the bombardments
reached their maximum
of intensity in April and May, 1918,
<i>i.e.</i> after the enemy had lost all hope
of crushing the Allies and taking
Paris.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the siege the
population took refuge in the south-western
districts, which were not as
yet bombarded, but on and after
November 22, 1914, when the
German shells reached the suburb of
Paris, a large number of the inhabitants
left the town.</p>

<p>In February, 1915, the exodus
began again, but at the end of May
in that year there were still some
26,000 people in the town. In
February, 1917, after twenty-eight
months of bombardment, there
remained 17,100 people, or 100,000
fewer than in 1914. At the beginning
of April in that year, the mayor
and later the sub-prefect, requested
all those who were not prevented
by their duties to leave the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>This invitation not having the desired effect, the military authorities, in
view of the increased intensity of the bombardment and the imminence
of the French offensive, announced that they could not guarantee food
supplies for the town, and decided that the civil population must leave not
later than April 10. The evacuation was effected by carts and motor-vehicles
to Epernay, where trains awaited the people.</p>

<p>A part of the inhabitants returned to Rheims after the French offensive
of April-May, but for a few months only, as, in February, 1918, the
coming German offensive compelled the civil population again to leave the
town.</p>

<p>During the thirty-one months, during which a considerable portion of the
population persisted in staying in Rheims (September, 1914, to April, 1917),
life and work went on in the bombarded city, the people adapting themselves
courageously to their precarious existence and to the danger. They were
supplied with helmets and gas masks, like the soldiers. Shell and bomb-proof
shelters were organised, and the cellars, with which the city abounds, became
the people's ordinary dwellings. The Town Council, with the exception of a few
members who left on the approach of the enemy, remained at the Town Hall
until it was destroyed, then installed themselves in a cellar, under the constant
chairmanship of the Mayor, Dr. Langlet. The services rendered by the
latter during these trying times were such that the French Premier decorated
him personally in November, 1914, with the <i>Croix de la Légion d'Honneur</i>.
The General Post Office had to change its quarters several times; but
until the complete evacuation of the town the postmen went their rounds
regularly.</p>

<p>The Courts of Justice were set up in the cellars of the Palais-de-Justice.</p>

<p>The archbishop, Mgr. Luçon, was absent from Rheims in 1914, being
retained in Rome by the Council. As soon as the latter was ended, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
returned to Rheims and thereafter, like his coadjutor, Mgr. Neveux, and the
unmobilized clergy, he remained at his post until the evacuation of April,
1917. The Cathedral architect, M. Sainsaulieu, who, like Mgr. Luçon,
has been made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, remained constantly
at his post, repairing from day to day, as well as might be, the damage
caused to the Cathedral, and saving the art treasures spared by the German
shells.</p>

<p>The firemen, reinforced in March, 1915, by thirty-two of their comrades
from Paris, devoted themselves, at the risk of their lives, to fighting the
flames caused by the bombardments. Unfortunately, their courage and
devotion were often unequal to their task. For instance, twenty-two
separate fires occurred on the night of February 22, 1915. Their task was
rendered still more difficult by the fact that the Germans often fired
on the burning buildings to drive off the men who were trying to save
them.</p>

<p>On July 6, 1917, the President of the French Republic fittingly acknowledged
the magnificent bravery of the firemen by personally decorating
their flag with the Croix de la Légion d'Honneur. At the same time he
conferred this dignity on the city (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_2">2</a></i>).</p>

<p>After remaining closed for several weeks, the schools re-opened. Until
then, the children had been too much in the streets looking for aluminium
fuses of shells, out of which they made rings, or for scraps of stained-glass
from the broken windows of the Cathedral. The first school, called the
"Maunoury" school, was installed on December 7, 1914, in a wine cellar
of the firm Pommery, Boulevard Henri-Vasnier, near the Rond-Point St.
Nicaise. On January 22, 1915, the "Joffre" school was opened in the
cellars of Messrs. Mumm, 24 Rue du Champ-de-Mars. Then came the
"Albert I." school, in the cellars of Messrs. Krug, 5 Rue Coquebert, and the
"Dubail" school in those of Messrs. Champion, Place St. Nicaise. In
addition to the underground schools, open-air classes were conducted. The
underground schools, in which the teaching staff, exclusively voluntary, lived
permanently, together with the school-children and their relatives, were
situated in the most exposed and frequently bombarded districts. The
"Dubail" school was struck three times: on March 6, 1915 (by an 8-in.
shell), and on March 25 and October 25, 1916. Luckily there were no
victims.</p>

<p>The schools were quite close to the enemy lines, the distance varying from
about two-thirds of a mile to a mile and a half.</p>

<p>In 1915 and 1916,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> the examinations for the "Elementary School Certificate"
took place in July, as usual. In 1915, the ceremony of the Annual
Prize Distribution, which had not taken place at Rheims for ten years,
was restored, the book-prizes for the pupils coming from every corner of
France.</p>

<p>The victualling of the town, thanks to the co-operation between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Municipal and Military Authorities, was effected with regularity. There
was never any shortage of bread. The butchers' and grocers' shops remained
open. The milk-women and hawkers donned their helmets and continued
to push their carts through the streets. The market-women remained at
their stalls. The nuns of St. Vincent-de-Paul, whose convent had been largely
destroyed, ensured the service of cheap meals, organised by the Municipality
for the poor. The undaunted inhabitants had their daily paper ("<i>L'Eclaireur
de l'Est</i>"), edited by M. Dramas, a courageous journalist, whose printing-house
was early wrecked by shell-fire, but who continued almost single-handed
to issue his paper.</p>

<h4>The Cathedral</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>The Cathedral of Rheims, which Charles VIII. declared to be "pre-eminent
among all the churches of the kingdom," and which a local poet in
the reign of Louis XIII. extolled above the seven wonders of the world, is
one of the most beautiful Gothic churches extant.</p>

<p>Few edifices combine such grandeur, simplicity and grace; still fewer, its
characteristic unity and symmetry.</p>

<p>The work of at least four architects, the building operations extended
over two centuries, yet it has retained rare unity both of plan and style.
The whole is so harmonious as to give the impression of being the effort of a
single master-mind.</p>


<h4>Historical Account</h4>

<p>The Cathedral stands on the site of former churches, successively erected
between the 5th and 13th centuries. On the night of May 6, 1210, a terrible
fire destroyed the then existing edifice, together with a portion of the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" width="600" height="621" alt="THE CATHEDRAL BEFORE THE WAR" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL BEFORE THE WAR</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Exactly one year later, Archbishop Aubri de Humbert laid the first stone
of a new edifice, which was destined to become the Cathedral of to-day.</p>

<p>Begun in 1211, the building went on without pause for twenty years,
after which, there was a slackening, followed by a vigorous resumption in
1299. Another pause occurred during the Hundred Years' War. The
Cathedral, less the tower spires provided for in the plans, was finished in 1428.
The spires were not yet built when the great fire of July 24th, 1481, entirely
destroyed the roof of the Cathedral, further deferring their construction,
which was subsequently abandoned.</p>

<p>The funds for this colossal work were furnished partly by the clergy and the
people, partly by Papal Indulgences granted to donors, and by collections in
Christian lands, especially in the ecclesiastical province of Rheims. The
wonderful plans of the Cathedral were long believed to be the work of <i>Robert de
Coucy</i>, whereas the original ones were in fact drawn by <i>Jean d'Orbais</i>, who
began their execution between 1211 and 1231. His work was continued with
wonderful fidelity by <i>Jean-le-Loup</i>, from 1231-1247; by <i>Gaucher of Rheims</i>
in 1247-1255, <i>Bernard of Soissons</i> from 1255 to 1290, <i>Robert de Coucy</i> until
1311, and afterwards by <i>Maître Colard</i>, <i>Gilles le Maçon</i>, <i>Jean de Dijon</i> and
<i>Colard de Givry</i> in the course of the 14th and 15th centuries.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries only repairs rendered necessary by the
wear of the stone were effected. In the 19th century, beginning in 1845,
important restorations, principally by Viollet-le-Duc, were carried out with
regularity.</p>

<p>The Cathedral's approximate measurements are 480 feet long (it is the
longest church in France), and 160 feet wide at the intersection of the transept.
The vaulting, less lofty than that at Beauvais (156 feet) and Amiens (143 feet),
is 123 feet in height. The towers are six in number (as in the cathedral at
Laon), of which the four situated at the extremities of the transept have
never had more than one storey. The principal towers are about 266 feet
in height, or about 60 feet higher than those of Nôtre-Dame in Paris.</p>

<p>The plan of the Cathedral is in shape a Latin cross, with radiating chapels.
It is built entirely of stone from the neighbourhood of Rheims. Forty
pillars support the vaults, which are further sustained by fifty buttresses.
Three great doorways and eight secondary doors give access to the interior,
which is lighted by a hundred windows and rose-windows; 2,303 figures of
all sizes decorate the exterior and interior.</p>

<h4>The Cathedral During the War</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>In revenging themselves on Rheims for their disappointments and failures,
the Germans seem to have been particularly determined to destroy the building
which is at once one of the most precious artistic treasures of France and one
of the most ancient evidences of her history. In 1814 the then Allies bombarded
Rheims but respected the Cathedral. It is true that there were
Germans who found fault with this respectful forbearance. One of them,
<i>Johann Joseph Goëres</i>, author of a voluminous work entitled "<i>Christian
Mysticism</i>," dared to write in April, 1814: "<i>Destroy, reduce to ashes, this
Rheims basilica, where Chlodoric was consecrated, and where was born that
empire of the Franks, those turncoat brothers of the noble Germans; burn the
Cathedral.</i>" In the course of the recent war the Germans followed the
vindictive advice of Goëres, although, less frank than he, they did not dare,
in face of the indignation of Christendom and of the whole world, boast of
their vandalism.</p>

<span class="caption">THE PIERCED VAULTING AND TOWERS OF THE CATHEDRAL IN 1919</span>
</div>

<p>By way of excuse they alleged sometimes errors in firing, sometimes
that the French had established a battery of artillery near the Cathedral
and an observation-post in one of the towers (a projector was installed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Cathedral, on September 13, 1914, <i>i.e.</i> the day that the French re-entered
Rheims, and it remained there only one night).</p>

<p>On November 9, 1914, General Rouquerol declared to the French Government,
who had demanded an enquiry, that the nearest battery to the Cathedral
was at that time more than 1,200 yards away; that on the day (September
19) the Cathedral was set on fire by the German shells, the nearest French
batteries were still quite close to the spot occupied by the above-mentioned
battery, whose position the French Premier verified personally. The
General concluded that the German artillery could not have made an error
of 1,200 yards in firing, but that they had deliberately aimed at the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Cathedral, though terribly shattered, is still standing. The description
of the edifice (pp. <a href="#Page_33">33</a> to <a href="#Page_60">60</a>) gives particulars of the damage and destructions
which occurred principally in September, 1914, April, 1917, and July, 1918.</p>

<p>On September 19, 1914, incendiary shells set fire to various portions
of the building. The roof was burnt, but the vaulting escaped injury. The
tambours of the side doors and the statues on the latter were destroyed by
the flames. The 18th century stalls, consecration carpet of Charles X.
and archi-episcopal throne were likewise burnt. The great rose-window of
the western façade, together with several other stained-glass windows, were
destroyed, as were also the "Angel" steeple and its caryatids above the
chevet. The northern tower was seriously injured by the burning of the
scaffolding around it (<i>see photo, p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a></i>). The statues were eaten into by the
flames and subsequently crumbled away, some of them being irrecoverably
lost.</p>

<p>In 1915 and 1916 the Cathedral was struck a hundred times, but it was
during the bombardments of April 15, 19 and 24, 1917, that it suffered
most. For seven consecutive hours, at the rate of twelve per hour, the Germans
fired 12-in., 14-in. and 15-in. shells on the edifice, causing terrible havoc,
especially to the south-western side.</p>

<p>During the terrible bombardments of April, 1918, the Cathedral did not
suffer&mdash;for once the Germans seemed to have decided to spare it; but,
unfortunately, the truce did not last. In the following months the bombardment
began again, and the ravages increased, especially in the two towers
and the vaulting. However, both vaulting and towers, in spite of their
injuries, have not been irreparably damaged in their vital parts, and are
capable of restoration.</p>

<p>That the damage is not more serious is due to the protective measures
taken by the Cathedral architect and by the Department of Historical Monuments.
As early as 1915, the doorways of the western façade were protected
with beams and sand-bags (<i>see photo, p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a></i>), while the Treasure was removed
and placed in safety, together with the paintings and tapestries.</p>

<p>In 1916 and following years masonry protections were placed around
some of the more valuable statues. The fallen fragments of carvings and
sculpture were carefully collected, with a view to future restoration. In
this way the débris of the head of the beautiful statue of the "Visitation"
Group, known as the "Smile of Rheims," on the left-hand side of the central
doorway of the western façade, were saved.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1918, it was found possible to save the remains of
the stained-glass of the windows, and other glass-work still intact&mdash;amongst
which was some of the finest in the nave. The salvage was difficult, for
scaffolding would have furnished the Germans with an excuse for further
bombardments. Recourse was had to a small body of Paris firemen and
two glaziers who, in foggy weather, and before daybreak, climbed up to
the iron framework of the windows and accomplished their work at great
heights with remarkable courage and skill.</p>

<h4>West Façade</h4>

<h6>(<i>See full views on pp. <a href="#Page_28">28</a> and <a href="#Page_29">29</a></i>).</h6>

<p>Better than any other, this part of the building reveals the desire for
unity and harmony which guided the various builders of the Cathedral.
The doorway, probably designed by Jean d'Orbais, was very likely not begun
till about 1250, by Gaucher, of Rheims. Bernard of Soissons built the
great rose-window and the façade as far as the Gallery of the Kings. The
architects of the 14th century built the lateral parts forming the first storey
of the towers, the Kings' Gallery and the gable. The upper storey of the
towers was only finished in the 15th century. Except for slight modifications
in detail, the original plan was respected. This façade, with its full open-work
towers and immense rose-window, demonstrates that the architects knew
how to obtain the maximum of resistance with wonderfully light construction.</p>

<p>The <b>Western Doorway</b> (<i>photo below</i>) comprises three doors flanked by
two full arcades, and surmounted by gables adorned with statues.</p>

<p>Between the gables are pinnacles on small columns (the left-hand ones
have been destroyed). At the foot of the pinnacles are statues of seated
musicians, which recall those on the house in the Rue de Tambour (<i>see p.
<a href="#Page_80">80</a></i>), but which have been partly destroyed.</p>

<p>The splaying of the doors is adorned with great statues backed up against
columns and separated by smaller columns, the capitals of which are connected
to a foliate frieze of elegant design. The bases are ornamented with
carved drapery. The tympana of the doors contain window-lights, while
five rows of statues, separated by lines of flowers and foliage, fill up the archings,
which suffered severely in the bombardment of September 19, 1914.
About a dozen subjects were destroyed or spoilt. During the subsequent
bombardments, shell splinters did further damage.</p>

<p>Generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> the sculptural decoration on the ground-floor dates from the
middle of the 13th century.</p>

<p>In September, 1914, several of the great statues of the lateral splayings
were completely destroyed and the others more or less seriously damaged.
However, subsequent damage was slight, thanks to the protective measures
taken in 1915.</p>


<h4>Central Door</h4>

<p>The lavish decoration of the central door suffered mutilations during the
last three centuries. The inscription carved on the lintel dates from 1802 and
replaced carving descriptive of the life of the Virgin, destroyed during the
Revolution. The sculpture on the arches, especially that of the three upper
lines, was partly restored in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<p>The beautiful statues in the splayings of the door represent: <i>to the right</i>
(<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a></i>), the <b>Annunciation</b> and <b>Visitation</b> (the latter group is striking
by reason of its inspiration from the antique); <i>to the left, the</i> <b>Purification</b>
(<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a></i>).</p>

<p>The Virgin of the Annunciation group was damaged by shell splinters
on September 4, 1914.</p>

<p>In the gable, a pretty group representing the <b>Coronation of the Holy
Virgin</b> was injured by the fires of 1914.</p>

<p>Of the two fine statues on the top of the buttresses framing the Central
door, only the right-hand one (<b>Solomon</b>) exists to-day; the other, representing
the <b>Queen of Sheba</b>, was destroyed by a shell in September, 1914,
except the head, which was saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>On the lintel, <b>Saint Paul</b>, blind, is being led to Ananias, who restores
his sight and baptizes him.</p>

<p>On the jambs are pretty little figures which have been variously interpreted.
The majority represent vices and virtues, <i>e.g. on the inner portion</i>:
<b>Courage</b>, in knightly raiment; <b>Cowardice</b> fleeing before a hare; <b>Charity</b>
holding out a purse; <b>Avarice</b> with a cash-box; <i>on the outer portion</i>: <b>Pride</b>
blasted and overthrown with his horse; <b>Sloth</b>, represented as a man seated
with his head resting on his elbows, in a stall; <b>Wisdom</b> seated, holding a book
and a lighted lamp. On the same jambs other figures are supposed to symbolise
the seasons: <b>Autumn</b> sitting on a vine-trellis; <b>Winter</b> standing before a
fire place; <b>Spring</b> in the midst of flowers; <b>Summer</b> with bared chest.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />RIGHT-HAND SPLAYING OF THE RIGHT-HAND DOOR<br />
<i>The two central figures have been decapitated.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The six statues in the splaying on the right (<i>photo above</i>) represent: the
aged <b>Simeon</b> holding Christ in his arms; <b>John the Baptist</b>, <b>Isaiah</b>, <b>Moses</b>
with the brazen serpent and the tables of the Law; <b>Abraham</b> about to sacrifice
Isaac; <b>Samuel</b> carrying a lamb (which has been broken). They differ by
their more archaic style from the other sculptures of the lower façade, and
closely resemble those of the central door of the north transept of the Cathedral
of Chartres. Like the latter, they date without doubt from the beginning
of the 13th century. Possibly they belonged to an earlier doorway, or were
prepared in advance for a purpose not realised, being finally utilised in the
place where they now stand.</p>

<p>The <b>Last Judgment</b>, in the gable, was severely damaged by shell splinters.</p>


<h4>The Left-Hand Door</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>This door, on account of the scaffolding which surrounded it, was seriously
damaged by the fires of September, 1914 (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a></i>).</p>

<p>On the lintel is <b>Saint Paul</b>, thrown from his horse at the gates of Damascus.
On the outside of the jambs, fourteen seated figures meditating, are supposed
by some to be embodiments of the arts and sciences, but represent more
probably prophets or teachers. Along the splayings are eleven statues,
which have not definitely been identified.</p>

<p>In the left-hand splaying is <b>Saint Nicaise</b> between two angels. The
right-hand angel, generally known as the "<b>Smile of Rheims</b>," was decapitated
on September 19, 1914. Fortunately, the fragments of the head of this
fine statue were saved.</p>

<p>The sculptures in the archings depict scenes from the Passion, while the
group which adorns the gable represents <b>The Crucifixion</b>.</p>

<p>These archings and gable were greatly damaged by the fires of September
19, 1914, and the bombardments.</p>

</div>


<h4>The First Storey</h4>

<p>In the centre is the great rose-window, best seen from the interior of the
nave. The stained-glass is broken. On either side, against the arching
which surmounts it, were two large statues. One of them, <i>David as a youth
in shepherd's garb</i> (also known as the <i>Pilgrim</i>), was destroyed by the
bombardments. The other very fine statue is variously said to be <i>Saul</i>,
<i>Solomon</i> and <i>St. James</i>.</p>

<p>The arching which begins above these statues was adorned with small
groups of figures representing scenes from the life of Solomon. Most of them
were destroyed at the same time as the Pilgrim statue.</p>

<p>Above the arching, a gigantic statue (twice restored) represents <i>David
challenging Goliath</i>. The bombardments of 1914 destroyed a similar
statue on the left representing <i>David slaying Goliath with a stone from his
sling</i>.</p>

<p>The first storey of the towers flanking the rose-window is broken by lofty
twin bays crowned with gables. The niches and pinnacles of the buttresses
are identical with those of the nave, but the style of their decoration denotes
a more recent period (early 14th century).</p>

<p>The northern tower was badly damaged by the bombardment of September
19, 1914, which fired the scaffolding around it (<i>see photo, p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a></i>).
Two of the pinnacled niches surmounting the buttresses were decapitated,
while the flames completely disfigured the statues, including that
of Christ.</p>

<p>A large calibre shell burst in the southern tower on April 19, 1917,
causing very serious damage.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />SECOND STOREY AND UPPER STOREY OF THE TOWERS</span>
</div>


<h4>The Second Storey</h4>

<p>The second storey comprises a series of niches, surmounted by sharply
pointed gables and adorned with gigantic statues, known as the <i>Kings'
Gallery</i>.</p>

<p>The central group, consisting of seven figures, commemorates the <i>Baptism
of Clovis</i>. Clovis, standing in the baptismal font; between Saint Remi,
receiving the Sacred Ampulla, and Clotilda.</p>

<p>The balcony in front of the <i>Baptism of Clovis</i> was formerly called the
<i>Gloria Gallery</i>, as it was the custom for the choir-boys to sing the <i>Gloria</i>
there on Palm Sunday.</p>


<h4>The Upper Portion of the Towers</h4>

<p>The upper storey of the towers, built on an octagonal plan, is flanked
with four open-work turrets, one of which contains stairs leading to the
platforms.</p>

<p>The northern tower, badly damaged by the fire of 1914, lost several of
the fine colonnettes of its corner turrets in 1918.</p>

<p>In the same year, the pierced staircase of the southern tower was almost
entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>At the time of the last restorations, the foundations of the spires provided
for in the original plans, but which have never been built, were laid.</p>

<p>In the belfry of the northern tower are two magnificent deep-toned bells.
One of them is modern and was cast at Le Mans, and blessed in 1849 by
Cardinal Gousset. The other, one of the finest bells known, and presented
to the church in 1570 by Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, is the work of the
Rheims metal-founder, Pierre Deschamps.</p>

<p>The scaffolding fire of 1914 reached the belfry, bringing down the bells,
which were broken in the fall.</p>


<h4>The Lateral Façades and Chevet</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>The lateral façades of the Cathedral are of rare beauty. Nowhere have
abutments and flying buttresses been so harmoniously employed as here.
They are not merely supports, but form part of the decorative scheme of the
nave, and ensure the harmony of the whole. Buttresses, finished off with
pinnacles, serve as points of support for two superimposed flying-buttresses.
The octagonal pinnacles are flanked with four small triangular pyramids
and supported in front by two slender detached columns. Between the latter,
under canopies, angels with outstretched wings carry the instruments of
the Passion and various other emblems (<i>see photo, p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a></i>).</p>

<p><i>Skirt the Cathedral on the left, passing in front of the North Façade (see photo
below), to reach the Northern Transept.</i></p>

<p>The transept is pierced with broad bays, whose completion, as in all the
windows of the Cathedral, consists of two twin arches surmounted by a six-leaved
rose. The niches in the buttresses are ornamented with statues
believed by some to represent Kings of France. At any rate, that of the
buttress on the western front of the north-west tower greatly resembles
the figure of St. Louis carved on the doorway of the church of St. Vincent at
Carcassonne.</p>

<p>The carvings of the lower windows were either destroyed or damaged
on September 19, 1914, at the same time as the stained-glass. The two
towers which flank the crossings were left unfinished.</p>

<p>Before the fire of 1481, there was a lantern over the intersection of the
transept.</p>

<h4>The Central Door of the Northern Transept</h4>

<p>The sculptural decoration, while rich, is more sober than that of the
doorway of the western façade. It is commemorative of the glory of the
Archbishops of Rheims.</p>

<p>The statue of the Pontiff with a tiara, backing up to the dividing-pillar,
is supposed to be that of St. Sixtus, first Bishop of Rheims. In the splaying,
on the left, is St. Nicaise holding his head in his hands, between St. Eutropia,
an angel and a figure improbably said to be Clovis.</p>

<p>The pediment was pierced by a shell and scarred with splinters. It is
divided into five tiers, and represent the life of St. Remi and St. Nicaise.</p>

<p>Beginning at the bottom, the figures represent: <i>on the first tier</i>, the
beheading of St. Nicaise by the Vandals and the Baptism of Clovis by
St. Remi; <i>on the second</i>, St. Remi, as a child, restores sight to Montanus
and, as a man, exorcises the demons who had set fire to Rheims; <i>on the third</i>,
the story of Job; <i>on the fourth</i>, the restoring to life of a young Toulouse
girl, and the miracle of the cask filled with wine by St. Remi; <i>on the fifth</i>,
Christ between two angels.</p>

<i>The dead rise from their graves.</i></span>
</div>


<h4>The Left-Hand Door of the Northern Transept</h4>

<p>This door, which has long been walled up, is called <i>The Doorway of the
Last Judgment</i>, on account of the carving on the tympanum.</p>

<p>In the upper part, Christ is supported on one side by the Holy Virgin,
and on the other by John the Baptist. Below (<i>two rows</i>) the dead rise from
their graves (<i>photo above</i>). Lower down, on one side are <i>The Virtues</i>, represented
by seated women; on the other, <i>The Vices</i>, mutilated in 1780 on
account of their realism. On the lowest tier, <i>to the left</i>, angels carry souls to
Abraham's bosom: <i>on the right</i>, Satan leads a chain of damned souls to Hell
(<i>photo below</i>), amongst whom are a king, a bishop, and a monk.</p>

<p>In the arching are three rows of angels carrying books or blowing trumpets,
and the wise and foolish virgins.</p>

<p>Backing up to the dividing pillar is an exceedingly fine 13th century
statue, which recalls the "<i>Beautiful God</i>" of Amiens Cathedral (<i>see the
Michelin Guide: Amiens Before and During the War</i>); Jesus blessing with
His right hand, holds the globe of the world in His left (<i>see photo p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a></i>).</p>

<p>This statue was decapitated by a shell which struck the doorway in 1918,
also taking off the head of the first statue on the left-hand portion of the
doorway.</p>

</div>

<p>According to local tradition, this plinth was erected
at the expense of a dishonest master-draper, convicted
of selling by false measure.</p>

<p><i>On the left</i>, the merchant is seen in his shop. In

<p>Near-by, burgesses talk together and seem to

<p>The six statues against the walls represent the
apostles: <i>on the right</i>, St. John, St. James and St.
Paul; <i>on the left</i>, St. Andrew, St. Peter and St.
Bartholomew.</p>

<p>The rose is carved in a voussoir; the uprights are
decorated with statues of Adam and Eve in long
tunics, and the arch with twenty-two groups of small
figures depicting, <i>from left to right</i>, the story of Adam
and Eve, the various tasks to which they and their
descendants were condemned, and the story of Cain
and Abel.</p>


<p>Above the rose an open-work gallery contains
seven statues of the prophets. The statues are 13th century, but the
gallery was restored in 1846.</p>

<p>The balustrading and triangular gable flanked with pinnacles, which
dominate the gallery, date from the beginning of the 16th century, but have
been repaired in recent times. On the gable is a colossal <b>Annunciation</b>;
the Archangel and Mary are under Flamboyant canopies.</p>


<h4>The Right-Hand Door of the Northern Transept (Norman Door)</h4>

<p>This little door formerly connected, by means of a vaulted passage, the
Cathedral with the Cloister (no longer existing) of the Chapter.</p>

<p>Its tympanum is a relic of the Cathedral built by Archbishop Samson.
It depicts, in beautiful Romanesque relief, a majestic Virgin. The archivolt
which frames it, doubtless belonged to a 12th century tomb. At the top of
the arch, angels carry away a soul, while on the uprights, clerks officiate at
a funeral service.</p>


<h4>The Chevet</h4>

<h6>(<i>See photograph of Cathedral, taken from aeroplane, p. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>.</i>)</h6>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chevet, begun by Jean D'Orbais and finished by Jean Le Loup,
was inaugurated by the Chapter about 1241. It is one of the finest 13th
century chevets in existence.</p>

<p>It is stayed by two rows of buttresses supporting double flying-buttresses.
Like those of the nave, the buttresses are surmounted with pinnacles, beneath
which niches shelter statues of flying angels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">

<span class="caption">THE CHEVET BEFORE THE WAR<br />
<i>One of the finest 13th century Chevets.</i></span>
</div>

<p>All around the apse, between the windows of the radial chapels and on
the main buttresses, are statues of angels, some of them of great beauty.</p>

<p>The 13th century clerestory gallery, which surrounds the upper portion
of the apsidal chapels, was restored by Viollet-le-Duc. It was partially
destroyed by the bombardments. On April 19, 1917, three large calibre
shells, which burst on the chevet, destroyed forty to fifty feet of it. At the
same time, the buttress jutting on the centre of the destroyed gallery lost its
pinnacle, and behind, an arch of the flying-buttress. The buttresses between
the above-mentioned one and the corner of the South Transept Tower lost
either a colonnette or their pinnacle with angel statue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The slender spire which, before the War, rose above the chevet, was known
as the <b>Angel Spire</b>, on account of a bronze angel which surmounted it, and
which was removed in 1860 as unsafe. This spire, the work of Colard le
Moine, was built in 1485, after the fire of 1481. Its pierced base with
balustrading was supported by eight leaden caryatids, some of which, in
the popular costume of the Louis XI. period, became deformed in consequence
of the rotting of their oaken core.</p>

<p>The fire of September 19, 1914, caused by the German shells, entirely
destroyed the spire and its caryatids.</p>

<span class="caption">THE CHEVET IN 1919<br />
<i>The roof with the &quot;Angel Spire&quot; was destroyed.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The bombardments in the spring of the following year further damaged
the gallery, also causing fresh mutilations to the flying buttresses and the
pinnacles of the apse.</p>

<p>A plain stone gallery with blind arcading, which formerly ran round the
chevet on a level with the springing of the roof, was replaced by Viollet-le-Duc,
with pierced battlemented arcading. Part of the original gallery which
surrounded the entire building, level with the roof, still exists on the northern
side.</p>

<p>On October 12, 1914, a shell destroyed about twenty five feet of the
gallery round the chevet, which later was further damaged by another shell.</p>


<h4>The Lateral Façade and South Transept</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>This façade and transept (<i>which should be seen from the courtyard of the
Archbishop's Palace</i>) are identical, as a whole, with the northern façade and
transept (<i>see pp. <a href="#Page_28">28</a> and <a href="#Page_42">42</a></i>).</p>

<p>The gallery at the springing of the roof of the nave was entirely rebuilt in
1878 by Architect Millet, in a style foreign to that of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Among the statues of the transept buttresses that at the corner of the
south-western tower, bestriding a lion, is thought by some to represent
<b>Pepin-the-Short</b>, and another near him, <b>Charlemagne</b>.</p>

<span class="caption">THE LATERAL FAÇADE AND SOUTHERN TRANSEPT IN 1919</span>
</div>

<p>The façade of the transept has no doorway. Above the lower storey, the
architectural arrangement is the same as that of the northern transept.
At the base of the rose-window, on each side, are two very fine statues.</p>

<p><i>On the left</i>, <b>The Christian Religion</b>, symbolised by a crowned woman
with chalice and standard. This statue was destroyed by a German shell
in 1918, after being damaged in April 1917.</p>

<p><i>On the right</i>, <b>The Synagogue</b>, with eyes bandaged and a crown on one
side, was not seriously damaged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">GABLE OF THE SOUTHERN TRANSEPT

</div>

<p>In consequence of the fire of
1481, the gable of South Transept
was rebuilt at the beginning
of the 16th century by three
master-masons, one of whom,
Guichart Antoine, co-operated
later with the building of <b>Nôtre
Dame de l'Epine</b>. (<i>See the Michelin
Guide: The Revigny Pass.</i>) It
was restored about 1888 in the
original style. The subject sculptured
on the pediment represents
the <b>Assumption of the Virgin</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Sagittarius</b> which surmounted
the gable was destroyed
in 1914. It was a modern faithful
copy of the old lead-covered wooden
Sagittarius, which was carved,
gilded and painted about 1503 by
the Rheims sculptor, Jean Bourcamus.
According to tradition,
this Sagittarius, which appeared to
be shooting its arrow at the bronze
stag of the archi-episcopal palace,
symbolised the rivalry between the
Archbishop and the Chapter of the
Cathedral.</p>

<h3>THE INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL</h3>

<h4>The Inner Western Façade</h4>

<h6>(<i>See description of the Exterior on pp. <a href="#Page_34">34</a> to <a href="#Page_41">41</a>.</i>)</h6>


<p>This is a masterpiece. Its sculptural decoration is unique, and as rich
as that of the outer façade.</p>

<p>In the tympanum of the central door a sixteen-leaved rose-window, the
stained-glass of which was made shortly before the Revolution, is faced with
three small trefoil rose-windows.</p>

<p>At the top of the dividing pillar St. Nicaise, headless, is between two
angels and two armed men personifying the barbarians who killed him.</p>

<p>The entire door, as far as the triforium, is framed by seven rows of superimposed
niches separated by panels of sculptured foliage. The basements are
covered with figured drapery, as on the outside. In each niche, under a
trefoil arcade, is a statue. The subjects represented are, <i>from bottom to top</i>:
<i>on the right</i>: <b>The Life of John the Baptist</b>; <i>on the left</i>: <b>The Fulfilment of
the Prophecy</b> and <b>The Childhood of Christ</b>.</p>

<span class="caption">STATUES ON REVERSE SIDE OF DOORS AFTER FIRE, SEPT., 1914</span>
</div>

<p>The first row on the right is known as "<b>The Knight's Communion</b>";
a priest offers the Host to a knight wearing 13th century armour, and turns
his back on another knight clothed in a leathern Carolingian tunic with iron
scales, and armed with a small round buckler.</p>

<p>Above the door, a gallery with nine openings lights the triforium.</p>

<p>On the highest storey, the great rose-window occupies the whole breadth
of the nave. It is the masterpiece of Bernard de Soissons (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a></i>).</p>

<p>In the form of a gigantic flower with twelve petals, each of the latter
is sub-divided by quatrefoils and trefoil archings. Its harmonious gracefulness
and seeming lightness, in spite of the great thickness of its border
(about 7 ft.), and mullions (about 2 ft. 6 in.), are very striking.</p>

<p>The stained-glass, which, with the stonework, formed a harmonious whole,
was restored in modern times. The subject represented was: <b>The Virgin
surrounded by angels, kings and patriarchs</b>.</p>

<p>The fire of 1914 destroyed the stained-glass.</p>

<p>The side-doors have only a quatrefoil rose-window (<i>see pp. <a href="#Page_25">25</a> and <a href="#Page_34">34</a></i>),
and their framework of niches consists only of four rows of two niches each.
However, two lines of niches, in which are statues in demi-relief, form the
contour of the arches which frame their top.</p>

<p>The subjects of the sculptures are allied, in the case of each door, to those
of the outer decoration, <i>i.e.</i> "<b>The Life of St. Stephen</b>."</p>

<p>The wooden doors and their tambours were destroyed by the fire of
September 19, 1914, which also disfigured or destroyed the statues framing
them (<i>see photos above</i>).</p>

<h4>The Great Nave</h4>

<p>The fire of September 19, 1914, destroyed the framework of the Nave
and its 15th century lead roof. In the following years a number of shells
pierced the vaulting, without, however, damaging its vital parts. It will
be possible to restore it.</p>

<p>It seems to be clearly established that although the first four bays were
built later than the others, the nave as a whole, like that of the Cathedral
of Amiens, was completely finished before 1300 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Vaulted throughout
on diagonal ribs, the nave, which is perfectly regular, has three stories:
the lowest, formed of great arches, rests on massive pillars; the triforium,
formed of two, four, five, or six arcades, extends round the entire building;
the high twin-bay windows are surmounted with a six-leaved rose-window.</p>

<p>The pillars, which have been likened to a row of antique columns, are
composed of a great cylindrical shaft, reinforced by four smaller engaged
columns, standing on an octagonal base. The pillars which follow the first
bay of the nave and carry one of the
corners of the towers, as also the four
pillars of the transept square, are more
massive.</p>

<img src="images/i060b.jpg" width="250" height="217" alt="CAPITAL IN THE NAVE" title="" />
<span class="caption">CAPITAL IN THE NAVE</span>
</div>

<p>The capitals of the pillars and of the
columns (<i>photo opposite</i>) are most beautifully
decorated. The dominating subject
of their decoration is natural foliage (vine,
oak, thistle, ivy, ranunculus, fig-tree).
Occasionally, human or animal figures or
monsters, and scenes from nature, <i>i.e.</i> the
dainty <b>Vintage scene</b> on the capital of
the sixth pillar on the right of the nave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
are interspersed. The ornamentation
of the capitals of six pillars
of the first bays is more elaborate
and more recent in style. These
capitals are not, like those of the
other pillars, divided on the four
flanking columns into two equal
courses by an astragal, neither do
they include, like some of the
others, crockets, acanthus leaves
and other conventional ornaments
of an older and less realistic style.</p>

</div>

<p>The 13th and 14th century
stained-glass of the high windows
represents, on two superimposed
lines, figures of kings of France
and archbishops of Rheims. Some
of the glass was broken, but the
finest was saved.</p>

<p>In the third and fourth bays
there was formerly a square
<b>Labyrinth</b>, flanked at the corners
by polygonal compartments. In
the interior, a line of white tiles
bordered with black stones ran
from one side, and after complicated
windings reached a central
compartment. At the corners of
the compartments were figures of
the four first architects of the
Cathedral: Jean d'Orbais, Jean
le Loup, Gaucher of Rheims and
Bernard of Soissons. The central
figure is probably that of Archbishop
Aubri de Humbert, who
laid the first stone of the edifice.
This Labyrinth, the drawings of
which revealed the names of the
builders of the Cathedral, was
destroyed in 1778 by the Chapter,
to prevent the children playing
there.</p>

</div>

<p>Between the Labyrinth and
the Choir are about twenty 14th
century tombstones.</p>

<p>The <b>great pulpit</b> set up
against the fifth left-hand pillar
was made, in the time of Louis
XV., by a Rheims artist (Blondel).
It comes from the old church of
St. Pierre-le-Vieil.</p>

<p>In the sixth bay, just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the entrance to the choir, the spot where St. Nicaise was beheaded, on the
threshold of his church, was formerly indicated by a small circular chapel
known as <i>La Rouelle de St. Nicaise</i>. The tiny building was replaced by a
memorial inscription on the flagstone, supposed to have been stained with
the blood of the martyr.</p>


<h4>The Aisles of the Naves</h4>

<p>The windows of the Aisles are similar to the lofty windows of the nave.
The walls were formerly hung with valuable tapestries, which were taken
down and evacuated by the <i>Historical Monuments Department</i> at the outbreak
of the War. The two oldest, dating back to about 1440, and known
as the tapestries of the <i>fort roi Clovis</i>, were presented by Cardinal Charles
de Lorraine, and depict the history of Clovis. Those of the Renaissance,
given in 1530 by Archbishop Robert de Lenoncourt, who caused himself
to be portrayed kneeling in the picture of the Birth of Christ, depict
the <i>Life of the Virgin</i>. The most modern, presented in 1640 by Archbishop
Henri de Lorraine and worked by the Fleming, Daniel Pepersack,
represent Jesus at the <i>Marriage at Cana in Galilee</i> and <i>Jesus among the
Doctors</i>.</p>

<p>At the foot of the walls, three stone steps serve as seats.</p>

<p>The inner façade is partially
hidden by the great organ, built
about 1487 and transformed several
times since then. Of the original
organ the loft only remains, the
Gothic balustrading of which is
pierced with Flamboyant arcading.</p>

<p>The façade originally consisted
of three lofty bays with lancet-shaped
windows surmounted by a
gallery lighted by three rose-windows
of six lobes each and one
of twelve lobes. The subsequent
addition of a doorway about the
<i>middle</i> of the 13th century caused
the partial suppression of the bays,
of which the transformed summits
alone remain.</p>


<p>Almost all the high windows
of the transept contained 13th
century <i>grisaille</i> glass, which was
damaged or broken by the bombardments,
as was also the 13th
century stained-glass of the great
rose-window (repaired in 1869),
which represented <i>The Story of the
Creation</i> and <i>The Fall of Adam</i>.</p>

<p>The reverse side of the Central Door is bare, except the dividing
pillar, the statue of which is hidden by the 18th century wooden
tambour.</p>

<p>The small western side-door, which formerly communicated with the
cloister of the Chapter, is entirely covered with 18th century woodwork.
The adjoining bay, closed in by a beautiful 13th century wrought-iron railing,
is the old chartulary or muniment room of the Chapter. Near the railing,
in the corner of the transept, is a clock with automatons, which come out
when the hours strike. Its woodwork is 14th and 15th century and its works
17th and 18th century.</p>

<p>To the right of the door of the organ stair, a <b>tombstone</b> to <b>Hugues
Libergier</b> was set up against the wall. He was the architect who, in 1231,
commenced the abbatial church of St. Nicaise. The tombstone has been
in the Cathedral since 1800. The altar in the Lady-Chapel, surmounted
with a statue by François Ladatte (1742), replaced a Gothic altar-screen
destroyed in 1739.</p>

<p>The picture <i>The Washing of the Disciples' Feet</i> is by Jerome
Muziano.</p>

<p>On the western walls of the transept is a fine tapestry, the pendant
of which is in the south transept. These two great tapestries,
made at the Gobelins, after cartoons by Raphael, represent the life
of St. Paul. They were removed in 1914, at the same time as those in
the aisles.</p>

<h4>The Choir</h4>

<h6>(<i>See the Chevet, p. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>The ambulatory with its radiating chapels is of incomparable beauty.
Excepting the larger central chapel, known as the <i>Chapel of the Holy
Sacrament</i>, which is nine-sided, each chapel has seven sides rising from a
circular floor.</p>

<p>In each chapel, three windows similar to those of the nave, light the
three hindmost walls. Blind windows imitate the true ones on the side walls.</p>

<p>At the base of the windows a narrow gallery, passing through the pillars,
continues all along the side-aisles of the transept and nave&mdash;a peculiarity in
Champagne architecture.</p>

<p>The 13th century stained-glass of the high windows was destroyed by
the bombardment of September 19, 1914.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, part of the vaulting fell in on the High Altar (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The costly marble High Altar was erected in 1747 by Canon Godinot,
who spent considerable sums in making alterations to the Cathedral, not all
of which were happy. Its six chandeliers date from the consecration of
Charles X.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The High Altar of the rear choir dates from 1764 and came from the
Church of St. Nicaise. On either side of this altar are two 14th century
tumulary stones. Behind is the tomb of Cardinal de Lorraine.</p>

<p>The small pulpit of the rear choir, the medallions of which depict the
life of St. Theresa, dates from 1678. It is a gift of the widow of M. Pommery
(<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>Twenty-two archbishops of Rheims were buried under the choir pavement.
Their tombstones were removed in 1747. The present flag-stones came
from the old church of St. Nicaise.</p>

</div>

<p>The archbishop's throne, by Viollet-le-Duc, was destroyed by the fire of
1914, together with the 18th century stalls.</p>

<p>The railings (1826-1832) replaced, not very happily, an ancient stone
rood-loft destroyed in 1761.</p>


<h4>The Interior of the Southern Transept</h4>

<h6>(<i>See plan, p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, and the Exterior, p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a></i>)</h6>

<p>A gap was made in the vaulting by the bombardment of April 19, 1917.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the inner façade is similar to that of the northern
transept, except that the three high bays with lancet windows, which are
partially hidden in the northern transept, are here entirely visible.</p>

<p>The stained-glass of the rose-window, destroyed by a hurricane in 1580,
was replaced in 1581 by the Rheims artist Nicolas Dérodé. It represents
the Eternal Father surrounded by the twelve apostles.</p>

<p>In the Rosary Chapel is a Renaissance altar-screen (1541), attributed to
the Rheims sculptor Pierre Jacques. The general scheme represents <i>The
dead body of Christ on the knees of the Virgin</i>, and above, <i>Christ coming forth
from the sepulchre</i>. It was a gift of Canon Paul Grandraoul, who is shown
on his knees before Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>The Roman mosaic work in the centre of the chapel was discovered in
the courtyard of the archbishop's palace in 1849. Among the most remarkable
scenes are: <i>Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene</i>, attributed to Titian;
<i>Christ with the angels</i>, by Thaddeo Zuccaro; <i>The Nativity</i>, attributed to
Tintoret; <i>Manna in the Desert</i>, attributed to Nicolas Poussin.</p>

<h4>The Cathedral Treasure</h4>

<p>This is kept in a sacristy built by Viollet-le-Duc, which is reached through
a plain door in the southern façade of the transept.</p>

<p>The treasure, which is very rich in precious reliquaries, chalices, and
other pieces of goldsmith's work, was saved from the fire of September 19,
1914, by the Curé of the Cathedral and one of his abbés. After being
temporarily placed in the house of the Cardinal, it was evacuated in 1915,
at the order of the Historical Monuments Department.</p>

<p>Among the best known of these art treasures are the Chalice of St. Remi
and St. Ursula's Skiff.</p>

<p>The <b>Chalice of St. Remi</b>, with its gold filagree work, six rows of chasing,
and precious stones set in a <i>collier</i>, is a remarkable work of art. It was in
this chalice that, by special privilege, the kings of France communicated in
wine at the conclusion of their consecration. Tradition has it that the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of which it is made was that of the Soissons Vase, whereas in reality it is
12th century. Confiscated in 1793 and deposited in the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>,
it was restored to the Cathedral by Napoleon III.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">ST. URSULA&#39;S SKIFF. (<i>Cliché LL.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p><b>St. Ursula's Skiff</b> is a reliquary given by Henri III. It represents a
ship carved out of cornelian, floating on a sea of enamel. The ship, whose
mast bears the royal crown, is adorned with the escutcheons of France and
Poland, and contains eleven small figures. That of St. Ursula is said to be
the portrait of the Queen of France.</p>

<p>Amongst the other remarkable works of art in the Treasure are the
following: the <i>reliquaries</i> of Archbishop Samson, St. Sixtus (12th century),
St. Peter and St. Paul (14th century), and the Holy Sepulchre (16th century);
a <i>monstrance</i> of gilt copper (13th century); a <i>liturgical comb</i> of ivory, said to
have belonged to St. Bernard (12th century); a rock-crystal <i>cross</i>, which
formerly belonged to Cardinal de Lorraine; <i>orfrays</i> embroidered with silver
thread (13th century); the <i>credence</i> and <i>oil vessels</i> of Abbot de la Salle; a
<i>fragment</i> of a carved wood crozier (incorrectly said to be the crozier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
St. Gibrien), two other fragments of which are in the Town Museum (12th
century); the <i>vases</i>, <i>utensils</i>, and <i>sacred ornaments</i> which were used at the
consecration of Charles X.; the <i>reliquary</i> of the Sacred Ampulla, designed
by Lafitte for the consecration of Charles X. The original Sacred Ampulla
was broken in 1793. The present one, which has only served for the consecration
of Charles X., is a replica said to have been made with the few
drops of balsam of the Clovis Ampulla, which pious hands saved from the
broken fragments of the sacred vessel.</p>

<h4>Place du Parvis</h4>

<p>The Place du Parvis (<i>photo below</i>) is in front of the main façade of the
Cathedral. The shells made enormous craters there.</p>

<p>In the centre of the square stands an <b>equestrian statue of Joan-of-Arc</b>,
by Paul Dubois, of which there is a replica in the Place St. Augustin in Paris.
It was removed in May, 1918, by the Historical Monuments Department
(<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The latter was completely destroyed.
Above the door was the inscription:
"In the year 1429, at the consecration of
Charles VII., in this hostelry&mdash;then called
the 'Striped Ass'&mdash;the father and
mother of Jeanne d'Arcq were lodged at
the expense of the Municipality." In
reality only the father of Joan-of-Arc
lodged there.</p>

<p>It was at the Hôtel du Lion d'Or
(<i>photo opposite</i>) and at the Grand Hôtel
(No. 4 in the Rue Libergier, which opens
out in front of the statue of Joan-of-Arc)
that the Field-Marshal French stayed
in August, 1914, and later General von
Zuchow, commanding the Saxon troops
which entered Rheims on September 4,
1914.</p>

<p>On the right of the Cathedral are
the ruins of the Archbishop's Palace
(<i>see plan, p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a></i>). A general view of them
is seen in the photograph on p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.</p>


<h4>The Archbishop's Palace</h4>

<p>Of the three buildings which surrounded every Cathedral in the Middle
Ages&mdash;the bishop's palace, the cloister of the canons, and the house set apart
for the sick and poor (Hôtel-Dieu)&mdash;only the archbishop's palace existed at
Rheims in 1914. It extended all along the south lateral façade of the
Cathedral, on the site of the ancient abode of St. Nicaise, which had replaced
a Roman palace. Of the ancient building erected by the successors of
St. Nicaise down to the 13th century, there remained only the graceful two-storied
chapel, doubtless contemporary with the chevet of the Cathedral.
The round entrance tower, known as Eon's tower (from the name of the
heretic who was imprisoned there in the 12th century), and the great bronze
stag placed in the middle of the courtyard by Archbishop Samson in the
11th century, still existed in the 17th century, but about that time the one
was demolished and the other melted down. This stag, into which on feast-days
wine was poured, which flowed out again by the mouth, was a beautiful
specimen of the art of the old metal-founders of Rheims.</p>

<p>The archbishop's palace and most of its rich collections were burnt in the
fire of September 19, 1914. Of the palace proper there remains only the
great chimney-piece of the Salle du Tau, on which the Latin motto, "Good
faith preserved makes rich," is inscribed (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a></i>), the very opposite of the
German "scrap of paper" theory.</p>

<p><b>The Archevêché</b>: The buildings which lined the courtyard were of
different periods. The wing abutting on the entrance-gate was 19th century,
while the correct but heavy and dull southern façade was rebuilt in the
17th century by Archbishop Maurice Le Tellier, from the plans of Robert
de Cotte.</p>

<h4>The Salle du Tau (or Kings' Hall)</h4>

<h6>(<i>See plan, p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>At the bottom of the courtyard there used to be a large late 15th and
early 16th century hall, access to which was gained by a horse-shoe stair with
late 17th century wrought-iron hand-rail.</p>

<p>A small porch-like structure at the top of the stair was an unfortunate
addition of 1825.</p>

<p>The hall was known as the <b>Salle du Tau</b>, in memory of the ancient palace
which was shaped like the Greek letter <i>Tau</i>, or the Kings' Hall, on account
of the portraits of the Kings consecrated at Rheims, received in 1825.</p>

<p>Built by the Cardinal Archbishop Guillaume Briçonnet between 1497 and
1507, it comprised two stories.</p>

</div>

<p>The upper hall, in which the
royal banquet was served at the
consecrations, became the Stock
Exchange at the beginning of the
19th century. It was disfigured
by poor paintings and false Gothic
ornamentation at the time of the
consecration of Charles X.</p>

<p>The walls were hung with four
admirable tapestries by Pepersack
and several others given by Robert
de Lenoncourt.</p>

<p>The vast chimney-piece with
the Briçonnet and Church of
Rheims Arms is all that the fire
of 1914 spared of the ancient
decoration. It is visible in the
photographs on page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, at the
bottom of the hall.</p>


<p>The lower hall, with its Gothic
arching, was as large as the upper
one. The capitals of the prismatic
pillars and the key-stones of the
arches were adorned with escutcheons,
fleur-de-lys, flowers and
crockets.</p>

<p>This was without doubt the work
of Jean d'Orbais, the first architect
of the Cathedral. It resembled the
latter in many respects.</p>

<p>With its seven-sided apse, four-bay
nave and lancet-shaped windows
without rubber-work, it was remarkably
slender and graceful.</p>

<p>Its finest ornament was the 13th
century bas-relief, <i>The Adoration of
the Magi</i>, in the tympanum of the
entrance door.</p>

<p>The white marble inner portico
of the door dated from the Restoration.
The other, formed of in-laid
wood panels, was adorned with five
16th or early 17th century painted
figures.</p>

<p>The lower chapel, partly subterranean,
was fitted up as a lapidary
museum in 1865 and 1896.</p>

<h4>The Royal Apartments</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>From the Kings' Hall, access was obtained to five royal saloons
with windows looking on the gardens and adorned with portraits of
archbishops.</p>

<p>It was in the archbishop's palace that the Kings stayed at the time of
their consecration or when passing through Rheims. Henry IV. lived there
during his two sojourns at Rheims. He washed the feet of the poor on Holy
Thursday in the great hall and listened to the sermon of Father Cotton.
Louis XIII. and Richelieu stayed there in 1641, Louis XIV. in 1680, Peter the
Great in 1717, Louis XV. in 1722 and 1744, the Queen in 1765, Louis XVI.
and Marie Antoinette in 1774, and Charles X. in 1825. From year VI. (Revolution
Calendar) to 1824 it was occupied by the tribunals. The archbishops
formerly held many Councils and Synods there, but lived there only rarely.
In the Middle Ages they preferred living in their fortified castle of Porte Mars
(<i>see p.</i> <a href="#Page_6">6</a>). In the 17th and 18th centuries they lived mostly outside
Rheims.</p>

<p><i>After visiting the ruins of the Archbishop's Palace return to the Place du
Parvis. Take the Rue Libergier, opposite the Cathedral, turning into the first
street on the right (Rue Chanzy). The Museum is soon reached (see Itinerary,
p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>).</i></p>


<p><b>The Museum</b>, formerly <b>The Grand Séminaire</b></p>

<p>This fine 18th century building was erected by Nicolas Bonhomme in
1743-1752. The carved entrance-door and terraced central pavilion, bordered
with a fine balustrade (damaged by shell splinters), are the remains of the
ancient Abbey of St. Denis, the church of which was destroyed at the time
of the Revolution. The right wing was rebuilt in the 19th century, by order
of Cardinal Thomas Gousset. The ground-floor of the left wing is old, but
the other floors are modern. These buildings were comparatively little
damaged by the bombardments.</p>

<p>Successively occupied since 1790 by the District Council, a free secondary
school, and by the Russians in 1814-1815, the buildings were handed over to
the Grand Séminaire in 1822. Since the separation of the Church and State
in 1905, they have been fitted up as a Museum.</p>

<p>The Museum was struck at the beginning of the bombardment on September
4, 1914, several pictures in the Modern Gallery being destroyed.
Later, it was again hit by shells, but the greater part of the collections had
already been removed to a place of safety.</p>

<p>The Promenades, greatly damaged by the war, have sometimes been
wrongly attributed to Le Nôtre. Their designer was a Rheims gardener,
Jean le Roux. Commenced in 1731, they were finished and extended in
1787. They were formerly reached by the Gates of Mars and Vesles, but
preferably by the Promenade Gate specially opened in the ramparts in 1740
and inaugurated by Louis XV. in 1744, on his return from Flanders. The
Promenades were first called <i>Cours Le Pelletier</i> (the name of the <i>Intendant of
Champagne</i>, who approved the plans), then <i>Cours Royal</i>, after the passage
of Louis XV. They were encroached upon by the railway station, built in
1860.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Promenades, opposite the station, in the <i>Square Colbert</i>,
laid out by the landscape gardener Varé in 1860, is a statue of Colbert.</p>

<h4>The Hôtel-de-Ville</h4>

<p>This building, which was destroyed by shell-fire on May 13, 1917, was
similar in many respects to the old Hôtel-de-Ville in Paris, burnt in 1871.</p>

<p>Commenced in 1627, from plans by the Rheims architect, Jean Bonhomme,
it was completed in stages, at long intervals. Only the central <i>pavilion</i> and
the left-hand portion were 17th century.</p>

<p>The building was a beautiful specimen of the architecture of the Louis
XIII. period. Seventy-eight columns, Doric on the ground-floor and Corinthian
on the first storey, framed the windows of the façade, whose bases on
the first floor carried trophies in bas-relief and a graceful frieze. The niches
in the central portico were empty, but the pediment on twisted columns
enclosed an equestrian statue of Louis XIII.</p>

<p>In the interior, in the great vestibule, a staircase with a remarkable wrought-iron
balustrade led to the City Library, which was destroyed by the fire of
1917 (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a></i>).</p>

<p>On the right, the room where the Municipal Council meetings were held,
contained rich panelling alternated with paintings by Lamatte, commemorating
episodes in the history of Rheims. On the left, the mayor's office
contained magnificent Louis XVI. woodwork.</p>

<p>On the other side of the courtyard, in the centre of which is a statue of
"La Vigne," by St. Marceaux, was the great marriage-hall, containing a Gallo-Roman
mosaic, framed with rosettes and an interlaced border, representing
a gladiatorial fight.</p>

<p>A number of the pictures and works of art in the Hôtel-de-Ville were saved
by the firemen and soldiers. The mosaic in the marriage-hall was protected
by sand-bags and is intact.</p>

<p><i>In the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, between the Rue Thiers and the Banque de
France, are two small streets: the Rue Salin and the Rue de Pouilly.</i></p>

<p>At No. 5 of the Rue Salin, the old 17th century <i>Hôtel Coquebert</i>, which was
destroyed by the shells, used to be the headquarters of the <i>Society of Friends

collections of this Society.</p>

<p>In the Rue de Pouilly, close to the Hôtel-de-Ville, are the <b>ruins</b> of the
<i>Galeries Rémoises</i> stores. These shops were partly housed in a Gothic building,
of which only a few chimney-stacks remain (<i>see chimney in photo below</i>).</p>

<h4>The Place des Marchés</h4>

<p>Built on the site of the ancient <i>forum</i>, the Market Square, before the
war, still contained several remarkable 15th century wooden houses.
Unfortunately, they were destroyed by the terrible bombardment of May
8-15, 1918, together with the Square.</p>

<p><i>After turning to the right, on leaving the Rue Colbert, and quite close to the
Square, at No. 4 in the Rue de l'Arbalète</i>, is the house, dating from the middle
of the 16th century, where <b>J. B. de la Salle</b> was born.</p>

<p>Although this house suffered from the bombardments of 1918, its front
is practically intact. It is the finest Renaissance front in Rheims, after that
of <b>Le Vergeur's House</b> (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a></i>).</p>

<p>The carriage entrance is flanked with two life-size caryatids, popularly
called <i>Adam and Eve</i>, on account of their nudity. Along the first storey
runs a broad frieze ornamentated with trophies of arms and a shield of
unknown significance. Between two windows of this storey a niche, resting
on a console, is crowned with a canopy. The shops on the ground-floor
somewhat spoilt the general look of the building. The interior of the house
was less interesting than the front.</p>

<p>In the courtyard is a strikingly graceful three-storey turret (<i>photo above</i>),
one side of which has collapsed.</p>

<p>Among the wooden houses destroyed by the bombardments of 1918 in
the Place des Marchés, the following must be mentioned: the <b>Maison Fossier</b>
(<i>see p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a></i>), which stood in the Square at the right-hand corner of the Rue de
l'Arbalète, and especially the <b>Maison de l'Enfant d'Or</b> (sometimes wrongly
called the House of Jacques Callou), which stood near the Rue des Elus.
The latter house took its name from an old sign representing the gilt figure
of a sleeping child. Hence, punningly, the name <i>Golden</i> or <i>Sleeping</i>
Child.</p>

<p>In spite of alterations, this house (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a></i>), with its pent-house roof,
two overhanging storeys, windows crowned with finials, and sculptural
decoration (<i>see carved console, p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a></i>), was a well-preserved specimen of
15th century architecture.</p>

<p><i>From the Place des Marchés, follow the Rue Colbert to the</i> <b>Place Royale</b>.</p>

<p>Commenced in 1756, from plans by the architect Legendre, it formed an
oblong, of severe and imposing appearance, at the cross-ways of the four
main streets of the City. In order to carry out Legendre's plans, forty-nine
houses had to be acquired and pulled down. The Square remained unfinished,
only three of its sides being built. The Louis XV.-XVI. transition style
houses were of uniform construction, and were remarkable for their arcades
and eaveless roofs, around which latter ran a balustrade. The central
house (formerly the <i>Hôtel des Fermes</i>) had a Doric front with a statue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Mercury surrounded by children arranging bales or carrying grapes to the
wine-press. A <b>statue of Louis XV.</b>, in the middle of the Square, was
protected from the bombardments by masonry-work (<i>photos, p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a> and below</i>).</p>

<p>The monarch is represented in a Roman mantle and laurel wreath. On
either side of the pedestal are two allegorical bronze figures. One, a
woman, holding a helm with one hand and leading a lion with the other,
symbolizes <i>gentleness of Government</i>; the other, a contented man resting
in the midst of abundance, represents <i>the happiness of nations</i>. The wolf
and the lamb sleeping side by side at their feet are symbolical of the
Golden Age.</p>

<p>The monument, inaugurated in 1765, is the work of Pigalle, but the two
allegorical figures, which are supposed to be portraits of the sculptor and his
wife, alone are original.</p>

<p>The original statue of Louis XV. was removed at the time of the Revolution
(August 15, 1792), and sent to the foundry. It was first replaced by a
pyramid surmounted by a "Fame," in memory of the defenders of the
<i>Patrie</i>, then by a plaster Goddess of Liberty, and in 1803 by a trophy of
arms and flags. The present statue, erected under Louis XVIII. (1818),
is due to the sculptor Cartellier, and is an exact replica of the original
one.</p>

<p>It was on the steps of the monument that the Conventionist Ruhl smashed

<p><i>From the Place Royale, return to the Market Square, cross over to the Rue de

<p>The Rue de Tambour owes its name either to the statue of a tambourine-player

<p>Previous to 1918, old houses in this street were still numerous. The
most celebrated was the now completely destroyed <b>Musicians' House</b>
(<i>photo above</i>), the true origin of which is unknown.</p>

<p>It has variously been supposed to have been the house of a rich burgess,
of the Tom Fiddlers' Brotherhood, and the Mint of the Archbishops of Rheims.
The first storey of the façade had been preserved intact since the 13th century.
In the Gothic niches which separated the mullioned and transomed windows,
five large seated figures on carved consoles (<i>photo above</i>) represented <i>a
tambourine and flute player</i>, <i>a piper</i>, <i>a falconer</i> with crossed legs, <i>a harpist</i>
and <i>an organ-grinder</i> crowned with a garland of flowers. The falcon on the
wrist of the central figure was removed by the organisers of the consecration
of Charles X., as it was feared that the royal banners might get caught
on it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these statues, which are remarkable for their natural
expression and vigour were removed to a place of safety before the house was
destroyed.</p>

<p>Thanks to a public subscription, the town was able to acquire them shortly
before the war, thus preventing them from being sold abroad.</p>

<p>The cellars of this house are curious, but there exists no proof that they
date back, as has been said, to the Roman period.</p>

<p>The adjoining house (No. 22) is 14th century, and probably dates back
to about the end of the reign of Philippe-le-Bel. Its front has been greatly
spoilt, but still contains a fine door surmounted by an elliptical arch (<i>photo

<p>At No. 13 of this street, two 13th century carved heads, one of a man
and the other of a woman wearing one of the mortar-shaped hats in fashion
until the end of the reign of St. Louis, have been built into the façade.</p>

<p>This monument was long believed to be a Roman <b>gate</b>&mdash;hence its name&mdash;although
the ornamentation of its four sides proves that it cannot originally
have been connected with the ramparts. It was only in the Middle
Ages that it was included in the fortified castle (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a></i>) built by the archbishops
a few steps to the rear. About 1334 its arcades were walled up,
while towards 1554 it was buried under a mass of rubbish during the building
of the fortifications. Partly disinterred in 1594, when the archbishops'
castle was pulled down, it was not completely cleared until 1816-1817.
Restored, then classed as an <i>historical monument</i> (thanks to Prosper Mérimée),
it is one of the largest Roman structures remaining in France. Forty-four
feet high, one hundred and eight wide, and sixteen thick, it was really a
triumphal arch built on the Cæsarean Way at the entrance to the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
probably in the 4th century. It comprises three arches separated by fluted
Corinthian columns which support the entablature. On the two main
façades between the columns are carved medallions and niches which have
lost their statues. The vaulting of the arches is divided into sunken panels,
the carving of which is mostly in a good state of preservation. Under the
eastern arch <i>Romulus and Remus</i> are seen suckled by the she-wolf. Under
the middle arch, the twelve months of the year, represented by persons
(five of whom have been destroyed), occupied in the labours of the four
seasons, surround Abundance and Fortune. Under the western arch Love
is seen descending from the sky above Leda and the Swan.</p>

<p><i>Behind the Mars Gate is the Place de la République, containing</i> a statue
by Bartholdi, damaged by shell-fire. <i>In front of the Gate, take the Rue

<p><i>Take the Rue du Grenier-à-Sel, on the right, to the</i> <b>Hôtel Noël de Muire</b>,

<p>This house consists of the remains of a sort of Henry II. manor with
turrets and dormer-windows. The walls, rounded at the corners like those
of the Templars, are of brick and dressed stone. The plinth separating the
two stories is decorated with carved wreathed foliage. Fret-work and hexagonal
points frame the windows, while a broad cornice on consoles carries
the roof. Formerly the residence of the lords of Muire, this house was
popularly known as the <i>Maison des Petits Pâtés</i>, on account of the polygonal
shape of the stones in relief. Theodore de Bèze, one of the leaders of the
Reformation in France, lived there with his friend, Noël de Muire.</p>

<p>The <b>Rue du Marc</b> was the quarter where the old noble families and the

<p>At No. 3 is a Henry IV. house, the windows of which are framed with
graceful ornamentation (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>However, the most remarkable house in the street is undoubtedly the

<h4>The Hôtel Nicolas Le Vergeur</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior building, which has a 17th century carriage entrance, offers
two fine examples of 15th and 16th century architecture. It is the finest
Renaissance structure in Rheims. The main front, incomparably the most
graceful, was but little damaged by the bombardments (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>On the ground-floor the great arched doorway is divided by a wooden
post into two delicately carved compartments. Pilasters decorated with
heads, flowers, birds, and horns of plenty frame the three stone-mullioned
windows. Above these runs a frieze of trophies and medallions, with
portraits of noble lords with upturned moustaches and pointed beards, and
of great ladies with <i>collerettes</i> and high head-dresses, gracious or haughty,
standing well out in relief.</p>

<span class="caption">HÔTEL NICOLAS LE VERGEUR</span>

<p>On the first storey, carved panels above the window form a sort of broad
frieze of bas-reliefs representing men-at-arms or knights of the time of
François I. and Henri II. fighting at tournaments with lance, sword, or
pike.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms overlooking the Rue Pluche were, a fine stone <i>mantelpiece</i>
decorated with graceful delicate foliage; a timber-work <i>ceiling</i> with
large and small beams, carrying panels decorated with scrolls, and
15th century <i>tile-flooring</i> of terra-cotta, varnished and painted green and
yellow.</p>

<p>At the back of the courtyard, a building, supposed by some to be an
old chapel, had been transformed into vast cellars and store-rooms. The
<i>oaken ceiling</i> of the latter, about fifty feet long and twenty-one broad,
destroyed in 1918, was one of the most beautiful in the world. The beams,
whose extremities carried grotesque figures, were carved on all their sides
with foliage, dragons, birds, and fruits. The beams were connected by joists
resting on stems, which represented apes, dragons, persons, and foliage.
Between the joists the panels had the appearance of scrolls.</p>

<p><i>After visiting the Hôtel Le Vergeur, turn to the right into the Rue Pluche,
which leads to the Place des Marchés. Skirt the Square on the left, then take
the first street on the left</i>: <b>Rue Courmeaux</b>.</p>

<p><i>At No. 18 are the</i> ruins of the <b>Hôtel Rogier de Monclin</b>, destroyed after
April, 1918. This house dated back to the Louis XV. period, but had been
disfigured by modern alterations. The façade overlooking the courtyard,
the entrance-hall, and the staircase with ornamental balustrade, were interesting.
At the time of the consecration of Louis XVI., one of the saloons
was furnished for the King's brother, the Comte (or <i>Monsieur</i>) d'Artois,
whence the name "<i>Rue de Monsieur</i>," formerly borne by the Rue
Courmeaux.</p>

<p><i>At No. 30</i> is a Renaissance door, almost intact (<i>photo below</i>).
<i>At No. 34, at the corner of the Rue Legendre</i>, is a late 16th century house,
whose interior arrangement and façade are intact, except for the woodwork
of the windows, which was modernised in the 18th century. It
was built on the site of the old wool-market, after Marshal de Saint-Paul,
at the time of the League, had compelled the inhabitants of the Faubourg
Cérès to destroy their houses.</p>

<p><i>The Rue Cérès ends at the Esplanade Cérès</i> (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a></i>), which was
made outside the old ramparts near the Cérès Gate. The name Cérès
is derived from a tower that long served as a prison (<i>carcer</i>, whence by
corruption <i>chair</i>, <i>cère</i>, and then by false
mythological association, <i>Cérès</i>). It was in
this tower (no longer existing, but famous
as early as the 9th century) that, according
to the <i>chansons de geste</i>, Ogier the Dane,
handed over by Charlemagne to the custody
of the Bishop of Rheims, was incarcerated.</p>

<p><i>From the Esplanade continue, if desired,
by the Rue du Faubourg Cérès</i> (greatly
damaged by the bombardments), to the
<b>Church of St. André</b>, a modern building
erected by the architect Brunette.</p>

<p>It was struck several times by shells
and will have to be rebuilt. As early as
the first bombardment of September 4th,
1914, shell splinters damaged the doorway,
transept, stained glass (part of which was
16th century and came from the old church),
small organ, and the painting of the <i>Baptism
of Clovis</i>. Subsequently, the vaulting and
parts of the walls collapsed.</p>

<p>The Church possesses a precious <b>reliquary</b>
of copper (15th century) and a <b>statue of
St. André</b> (patron of the church) of painted
and gilded stone, attributed without authority,
to Pierre Jacques.</p>

<p>An imposing building, bordered with streets on its four sides, it had
retained its original appearance. The carriage-entrance in the Rue Eugène
Desteuque alone had been rebuilt in 1697. The principal entrance was
surmounted with a gallery, the walls, ceiling and beams of which were
covered with delicate decorative paintings.</p>

<p>On the first floor one of the corner rooms, looking east, contained a large
Henry IV. mantelpiece, above which were the arms of the nobles of Prain.
Only the metallic portion remains.</p>

<p>The Rue Carnot communicates with the courtyard of the Chapter-House,
also burnt, by a great gate and passage which pass right through a
house.</p>

<p>This entrance was built about 1530, in the transition style between the
Gothic and Renaissance. Its elliptical arch bears a scutcheon with the arms
of the Chapter. Consoles, decorated with grotesque figures, support the
beams. The points of the turrets have disappeared, a supporting shaft has
been mutilated, and the carved wooden leaves of the door have been removed
to the Lycée, yet the gate is still imposing.</p>

<p>It is the last remaining vestige of the Chapter buildings which, with their
gates closing at the same time as those of the city, at the sound of the bell,
formed a "city within a city." In point of fact, the Chapter was once lord
of that part of the city which lies around the Cathedral, and which it administered.
The canons, jealous of their prerogatives, were often in conflict
with the archbishops.</p>

<p>The Lycée replaced the old <i>Collège des Bons Enfants</i>, founded in the Middle
Ages, and rebuilt in the 16th century by the Cardinal de Lorraine, founder of
the University of Rheims.</p>

<p>Of the old <i>Collège</i>, only the central part remained, in the second court
built by Archbishop Charles Maurice Le Tellier in 1686 and the following
years.</p>

<p>The gate of the <i>Cour des Etudes</i> dates from 1688.</p>

<p>The ancient door of the Collège&mdash;the tympana of whose arcading contain
two laughing and crying heads&mdash;was transferred to the entrance of the
<i>Petit Lycée</i>, at No. 5 of the street on the right of the Lycée (Rue Vauthier-le-Noir)
(<i>photo above</i>).</p>

of St. Pierre-les-Dames</b>.</p>

<p>Of this celebrated Abbey, where several royal persons stayed: <i>Mary
Stuart</i> twice, in her childhood and after she was widowed; <i>Henry IV.</i>, on a
visit to his cousin, the Abbess Renée II.; <i>Anne of Austria</i>, of whom the
<i>Congrégation</i> library contains a portrait; there remains hardly anything but
two 16th century <i>pavillons</i> belonging to the period when Renée de Lorraine,
sister of the Queen of Scotland and aunt of Mary Stuart, was abbess of the
convent. Built of stone and brick with marble incrustations, and adorned
with beautiful carvings, these <i>pavillons</i> were pure Renaissance in style.
The head of an angel with unfolded wings and the head of a grinning demon
surmounted the two windows of one of the ground-floors. On the first floor
of the same <i>pavillon</i> the window, framed with delicate ornaments, opened
above a cornice, the principal sculptural subject of which was a nude woman,
helmeted, suckling two children.</p>

<p>This large building, occupied by the <i>Cercle Catholique</i>, was commenced
about 1540 by Hubert Féret, a <i>Lieutenant</i> of the people, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
celebrated member of a family which played an important part at Rheims
in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. The outside façade has been greatly
altered. At No. 137 it was entirely rebuilt under Louis XVI. At No. 139
the ground-floor openings have been modified.</p>

<p>As in many of the mansions of the 16th century, most of the decoration
is on the inner façades. Inside the courtyard, on the ground-floor of the
wing abutting on the Rue Montlaurent, there is a six-arched gallery which
was damaged but not destroyed (<i>photo,</i> p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>). Between the arch-centres
and at the ends of the gallery are seven niches, three feet high, enclosing
stone statues of the sun and the six planets known in the 16th century.</p>

<p>Taken in their order they are: <b>Saturn</b>, with a scythe in his hand and
serpent round his arm, devouring a child, and the zodiacal signs Aquarius
and Capricornus at his feet; <b>Jupiter</b>, holding a lighted torch, with Sagittarius
at his feet; <b>Mars</b>, armed from head to foot, surmounting Cancer and Aries;
the <b>Sun</b>, personified by Ph&oelig;bus with flowing mantle, a lion at his side;
<b>Venus</b>, clothed only in her hair, surmounting Taurus and Bal&oelig;na; <b>Mercury</b>,
with wings on his head and heels, the caduceus in his hand, Virgo and Gemini
at his feet; the <b>Moon</b>, represented by Diana bearing a crescent; below her
Scorpio.</p>

<p>The escutcheons on the wall at the back of this façade bear the initials
of Régnault Féret, who completed the mansion. In the second court there
are still vestiges of the chapel of this family.</p>

<p><i>At No. 142 of the same street</i>, the entrance to the <b>Cour Maupinot</b> (one of
the numerous <i>cours</i> which have survived in Rheims) is framed in pilasters,
the carved entablature of which supports a triangular pediment (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>The Place St. Nicaise was destroyed by the bombardments of April-August,
1918. It took its name from the celebrated Bishop of
Rheims, who, with his sister St. Eutropia, was put to death by the Vandals
in 407.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Nicaise, rebuilt in the 13th century by Libergier and
Robert de Coucy, was destroyed at the time of the Revolution. Amongst
other curiosities it contained a loose pillar, which Peter the Great had pointed
out to him at the time of his journey through Rheims.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Place St. Nicaise, between the Boulevard Victor-Hugo
and the Rue St. Nicaise, is the entrance to the <b>Champion Cellars</b>,
in which the <i>Dubail</i> school was installed during the war (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a></i>).</p>

<p><i>Take the Rue St. Nicaise to the Boulevard Henry Vasnier (photo below),
turn into the latter, on the right, and follow same as far as the</i> <b>Rond-Point
St. Nicaise</b>.</p>

<p>All this part of the town, which was quite close to the German lines,
was constantly under the fire of their guns. It was violently bombarded
during the German offensives of May, June and July, 1918.</p>

<p><i>Near the Rond-Point de St. Nicaise are the</i> <b>Pommery Cellars</b>, which
gave shelter to many citizens and school-classes during the war (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a></i>).</p>


<h4>The Pommery Cellars</h4>

<p>These cellars are among the finest in Rheims, and form, with their
eleven miles of streets, squares and boulevards lighted by electricity, rail-tracks,
waggons, lifts, electric pumps and siphons, quite an underground city.
A visit to them will give the tourist an idea of the importance and complexity
of the Champagne wine industry in Rheims.</p>

<p><i>The Boulevard Diancourt, which skirts the Square St. Nicaise, begins at
the</i> Rond-Point St. Nicaise.</p>

<p>This square was much cut up by the bombardments, and by the trenches
and defensive works made there during the war (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The square contains two eminences, from the top of which there is a fine
panoramic view of Rheims.</p>

<p>The photograph on page <a href="#Page_27">27</a> was taken from the eminence nearest the
Rond-Point St. Nicaise.</p>

<p>The other eminence is crowned by a limestone tower&mdash;all that remains of
the ancient city ramparts.</p>

<p><i>Follow the Boulevard Diancourt to the Place Dieu-Lumière.</i></p>

<p>The name <i>Dieu-Lumière</i>, borne by the old gate through which Joan-of-Arc
and the Dauphin entered Rheims, was not derived, as supposed at the
Renaissance, from the Sun-God Apollo, but from the old Gate <i>Dieu-li-Mire</i>
(God the Physician), so called in the Middle Ages on account of the proximity
of a Cistercian hospital.</p>

<p><i>Cross the square and take the Rue Dieu-Lumière on the right to the</i> Place
St.-Timothée. The wood-panelled houses, whose <i>loges</i> faced the Place
St.-Timothée, were destroyed by the bombardments of April-September,
1918, except the one at the corner of the Rue St. Julien. This house, though
severely damaged, has retained its butcher's stall with 17th century wooden
balustrading.</p>

<p><i>Take the Rue St. Julien on the left to the Place St.-Remi, in which stands the</i>
<b>Church of St. Remi</b>.</p>


<h4>The Church of St. Remi</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The Church of St. Remi is the oldest church in Rheims, and one of the
oldest in all France. Although it is not certain that it replaced a Roman
basilica, said to have stood on the site of the present transept, there is no
doubt that Gallo-Roman building materials, taken from neighbouring edifices,
were used in its construction or restoration.</p>

<p>To-day, the church covers a ground-space of about an acre and a quarter.
In shape a Latin cross, it measures inside about 450 feet in length, 98 feet
in breadth and 124 feet in height under the vaulting. Only the southern
façade shows to advantage, but in spite of its varied styles, which mark the
different stages of its growth, the church realises to the full the purpose of
its founders. Its architecture and decoration, especially in the interior,
make it, as was intended, a grand and dignified depository for sacred
remains.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Remi stands on the site of a former cemetery, in the
middle of which was the Chapel of St. Christopher, where St. Remi was
buried. The chapel soon became popular and grew rapidly, especially between
the 6th and 9th centuries, when it became a great fortified church. The
present church, which replaced it, is not only one of the finest Romanesque
churches in the north of France, but also forms a curious epitome of the history
of architecture for several centuries. Begun in 1039 under Abbot Thierry,
it was still far from finished when consecrated in 1049 by Pope Leo IX.
Building was continued in 1170 by Abbot Pierre de Celle, the future Bishop
of Chartres, whose restorations were the first application of the Gothic style
to a great building in Rheims; in the 13th and 14th centuries, under Abbot
Jean Canart, and in the 15th century, under Abbot Robert de Lenoncourt.
Partially transformed at the end of the 16th century, it has been restored
and partly rebuilt at intervals since 1839.</p>


<h4>The Church of St. Remi during the War</h4>

<p>The Church of St. Remi escaped severe damage until the middle of 1918.
The bombardment of September 4, 1914, injured one of the tapestries
depicting the life of St. Remi, and destroyed a fine painting: <i>The Entry of
Clovis into Rheims</i>. The bombardment of November 16, 1914, wrecked the
apsidal chapel of the Virgin, bringing down the vaulting, destroying the
key-stone and pointed arches, crushing the altar beneath a heap of ruins,
smashing the magnificent windows of the apsidal gallery, and destroying
the priceless 12th century stained-glass depicting <i>Christ crucified between the
Virgin and St. John</i>. The Church narrowly escaped destruction when the
Hôtel-Dieu Hospital was burnt down in 1916. From April, 1918, it was
marked down by the German batteries. The roof was entirely burnt,
and the dummy vaulting of the nave collapsed. Of the fine 15th century
timber-work nothing remains, but parts of the lofty 13th century vaulting
over the choir and transept withstood the bombardment. The treasure,
tapestries, sacristy doors, storied tile-flooring of the chapel of St. Eloi,
the old stained-glass of the lofty windows, and the apsidal windows round
the gallery of the first storey, were saved by the Historical Monuments
Department.</p>

<p>The tomb of St. Remi is intact. The relics of the saint which, at the
request of the Archbishop of Rheims had not been disturbed, were removed
by the vicar of the parish at the time of the final evacuation of the town.
The reliquary was taken away by officers at a later date, while the church was
burning.</p>


<h4>The Apse of St. Remi Church</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The Apse was rebuilt under Pierre de Celle in 1170, in early Gothic. Five
three-sided radiating chapels arranged in three stages, one behind the other,
have flowing and elegant lines, broken by the enormous projections of the
buttresses which were added at a later period.</p>

<p>This apse is one of the earliest religious edifices in France, in which flying
buttresses were employed.</p>

<p>The latter, very simple in design, rest on outside fluted columns detached
from the wall of the apse. This is one of the last examples of fluting, as
applied to columns, the process disappearing generally with the introduction
of pointed architecture, only to reappear at the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The persistence of this fluting is doubtless explained by the influence
of the many specimens of Roman architecture which Rheims had preserved.</p>


<h4>The Doorway of the Southern Transept</h4>

<p>Although the transept dates from the 11th century, its southern façade
was built in 1480 by Robert de Lenoncourt.</p>

<p>The doorway, which bears the Lenoncourt arms, comprises only one door,
divided by a pillar with statues of St. Remi and the Virgin.</p>

<p>The deep vaulting of the door is ornamented with vine-foliage. At the
base, in the supporting walls, are statues of St. Sixtus and St. Sinicius (the
first missionaries to Rheims) bare-footed, clothed in long embroidered mantles
and holding books. In the vaulting above the head-covering of the missionaries
are eight groups of statuettes representing episodes in the Life and
Passion of Jesus.</p>

<p>Tourists who follow the Itinerary on page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>, come out by the Rue
St. Julien, in front of the doorway of the south transept. The latter is
between the ruined apse (<i>on the right</i>) and the south lateral façade (<i>on the
left</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The 15th century leaves of the door are composed of wood panels in
blind arcading, ornamented with flowering clover.</p>

<p>On the buttresses which frame the doorway are five statues of saints,
including St. Remi, St. Benedict, and St. Christopher carrying a kneeling
Jesus on his shoulder.</p>

<p>The tympanum of the gable above the great flamboyant window is
arranged on a Gothic pediment. Its decoration represents the <i>Assumption
of the Virgin and her crowning in Heaven</i>.</p>

<p>On the top of the pediment, and crowning the whole, is St. Michael
trampling Satan underfoot.</p>

<p>The whole of the doorway is a beautiful example of Flamboyant Gothic.
Its rich carvings and delicate ornamentation are in striking contrast with
the severity of the rest of the building.</p>

<p>At the intersection of the transept, there was formerly a wooden spire,
built in 1394, which was pulled down as unsafe in 1825, by order of those
who had charge of the arrangements connected with the consecration of
Charles X.</p>

<p>On the right-hand side of the transept, and also in the north transept,
are small semi-circular chapels.</p>


<h4>South Lateral Façade</h4>

<p>This front has the bare, massive appearance of the 11th century buildings.
The remarkable Roman arches, massive buttresses and blind doorway, framed
by two primitive capitals with a wreath-shaped astragal, are apparently
vestiges of constructions of an earlier date than those of Abbot Thierry.</p>

<p>The semi-cylindrical abutments are among the oldest of mediæval
buttresses. They are crowned with cones or capitals, the greater part of
which are devoid of decoration.</p>

<h4>The West Front of St. Remi Church</h4>

<p>Between its two towers, this gabled façade, the recesses and blind arcading
of which form almost its sole decoration, is in strong contrast with the principal
façade of the Cathedral. At once elegant and severe, like most of the monastic
buildings of the 12th century, it lacks unity. All that part situated above
the five windows of the first storey, including the rose-window, has been
rebuilt in modern times. The very simple rose-window, between two lines
of superimposed arcading, is protected, in the Champagne style, by a relieving-arch.
The northern tower (<i>on the left</i>) was almost entirely rebuilt in the
19th century, on the lines of the old one. The simpler southern tower (<i>on
the right</i>), with its arched windows and loopholes, is Roman of the 11th or
12th century. The pointed part of the façade is late 12th century, and dates
from the time of the restorations by Pierre de Celle.</p>

<p>Three doors open on the nave. The central one is flanked by two columns
with statues of St. Peter and St. Remi. The marble and granite columns
came, no doubt, from some neighbouring Gallo-Roman building. These
statues, with arms pressed close to their sides in the ancient stiff manner, are
probably from the original basilicas.</p>

<p>Here, the architecture is peculiar. Pierced columns form a gallery
connecting the upper courses. The galleries of the first storey are supported
by two great columnar shafts, each formed of two portions joined by a stone
ring and surmounted by bell-shaped marble capitals. The columns and
capitals are Gallo-Roman.</p>

<h4>The Nave</h4>

<p>Alterations were made at different times to the nave which, in the 11th
century, had a timber-work roof. Pierre de Celle lengthened it by two bays,
the pointed arches of which contrast with the circular ones of the lower bays,
and also increased its height. <i>Note the ogives above the round arches.</i> The
visible timber-work was replaced with vaulting on diagonal ribs sustained
by clusters of small Gothic columns backing up against the Roman piers,
the latter being still visible. These heavy piers (composed of fourteen small
columns) which surround the central nave, and whose capitals (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_108">108</a></i>),
with Barbaric wreathed astragals and foliage, recall the Carolingian period,
contrast strikingly with the lightness of the apse. They are undoubtedly
11th century. All the stone vaulting of the nave, as far as the transept,
was replaced after 1839 with wood and plaster, which collapsed under the
bombardments of 1918, when the roof was burnt.</p>

<p>The pulpit, with its Benedictine monogram, is late 17th century. It is
ornamented with three bas-reliefs: <i>St. Remi receiving the Sacred Ampulla</i>,
<i>St. Benedict imploring the Holy Spirit</i>, and <i>St. Benedict giving the Injunction
to his monks</i>. As far as the pulpit, on both sides of the nave, the granite
columns resting on the piers date from the Gallo-Roman period.</p>

<p>Those given by Robert de Lenoncourt and restored by <i>Les Gobelins</i>, are
rich in composition and decorative effect. In an architectural frame of the
Renaissance period, they represent the following legendary scenes from the
life of St. Remi, the costumes belonging to the period of François I.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The blind hermit Montanus visits the new-born Remi, who, touching him
with his fingers wet with milk, restores his sight.</p>

<p>2. The hermit St. Remi, called by the people to the bishopric, receives
the mitre.</p>

<p>3. Four miracles are performed by the saint: he extinguishes a fire lighted
by demons in the city; he restores life to a girl; he is served at table by
angels; when wine ran short at the table of his cousin Celsa, he blessed an
empty cask, which was immediately filled.</p>

<p>4. The Battle of Tolbiac; Clovis instructed and baptized by Remi;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the miraculous dove and an angel bring from heaven the Sacred Ampulla
and the fleur-de-lys scutcheon.</p>

<p>5. Remi gives Clovis a cask of wine, telling him that he will always be
victorious so long as the cask remains full; a miller who refused to give his
mill to the Church, sees his wheel turn the wrong way and his mill fall
down; St. Génebaud, Bishop of Soissons, punished by Remi for his sins,
is afterwards delivered from his fetters by the saint.</p>

<p>6. The miracle of Hydrissen: Remi raises a man from the dead, who
confirms his wish to leave a portion of his wealth to the Church, to the confusion
of his son-in-law who contested the will.</p>

<p>7. Remi contemplating a heap of corn which he had collected to provide
against famine, and which some drunkards had burnt. At a Council, Remi
paralyses the tongue of a heretic priest, and then restores speech to him after
repentance.</p>

<p>8. Remi, singing Matins in the chapel of the Virgin, is assisted by St. Peter
and St. Paul and blessed by Mary. Remi, blind, dictates his will in the
presence of St. Génebaud and St. Médard. Remi recovers his sight, celebrates
mass and gives the Communion to his clergy. Remi dies and four angels
carry away his soul.</p>

<p>9. Remi's funeral; the procession goes towards the church of St. Timothy,
where it is proposed to bury the saint, but in front of St. Christopher's, on
the site of the present basilica, the saint, by making it impossible to lift his
coffin, manifests his desire to be interred in this chapel. The saint's winding-sheet,
carried in procession, dispels the plague that had been ravaging the
city.</p>

<p>10. Angels transfer the relics of the saint to his mausoleum. A soldier
who had tried to break in the door of the church, cannot withdraw his foot.
Remi punishes the Bishop of Mayence, guilty of theft. Remi reveals himself
with the Virgin and St. John. The Archbishop of Rheims, Robert de Lenoncourt,
kneeling, presents the ten pieces of tapestry to the saint.</p>

<p>The latter tapestry was riddled with splinters (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_110">110</a></i>) during the
bombardment of September 4, 1914.</p>


<h4>The Treasure</h4>

<p>This was kept in the sacristy, the 15th century carved wood doors of
which have Flamboyant style frames.</p>

<p>Formerly the richest of all the church treasures of France, it was impoverished
in the course of the centuries, through wars and revolutions.</p>

<p>The <b>enamels</b> by Landin of Limoges (1633), dedicated to the lives of
St. Timothy and St. Remi, a 12th century abbot's <b>crozier</b>, <b>reliquaries</b>
and <b>sacerdotal ornaments</b> are noteworthy.</p>

<p>The treasure was removed, together with the doors of the sacristy, by the
Historical Monuments Department.</p>


<h4>The North Transept</h4>

<p>Three small white marble Gallo-Roman or Carolingian capitals crown the
colonnettes of the triforium.</p>

<p>Formerly, the church contained several tombs. Let into the wall of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
north transept is a Latin epitaph, praising the virtues of a woman named
Guiberge, who seems to have combined in her person the perfections of six
women, <i>i.e.</i> the beauty of Rachel, the fidelity of Rebecca, the modesty of
Susanna, the piety of Tabitha, the warm affections of Ruth, and the high
morals of Anna.</p>

South Transept Door.</i></span>
</div>


<h4>The South Transept</h4>

<p>The first chapel on the right of the apse, against the transept, is the chapel
of St. Eloi.</p>

<p>In 1846, forty-eight storied flag-stones, taken from the flooring of the
sanctuary of the church of St. Nicaise and collected by the architect Brunette,
were placed there.</p>

<p>These 14th century lozenge-shaped stones are engraved in black, the
hollowed-out portions being filled with lead. Each stone has a pretty border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with a square medallion, in the middle of which two or three figures represent
a scene from the Old Testament, from Noah to Daniel in the lions' den.</p>

<p>This chapel also contained two very expressive mediæval statues of
painted wood and a 14th century Christ, all of which came from the old church
of St. Balsamic.</p>

<p>The second chapel on the eastern side of the south transept contained an
Entombment dating from 1531. In this group, which belonged to the old
church of the Commandery of the Temple of Rheims, Joseph of Arimathea
and Nicodemus hold the winding-sheet. Salome, and Mary the mother of
St. James, stand near the tomb, while the Virgin, overcome with grief, is
supported by St. John.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ENTOMBMENT, FORMERLY IN ONE OF THE

</div>

<p>Facing this Burial Scene was the Altar-screen of the Three Baptisms,
the work of Nicolas Jacques and the gift of Jean Lespagnol in 1610. This
screen, which formed the background of the baptismal fonts, represented in
three bas-reliefs: The baptism of Clovis (<i>on the right</i>), the baptism of Jesus
by John the Baptist (<i>in the centre</i>), and the baptism of Constantine (<i>on the
left</i>).</p>

<p>The railing round the baptismal fonts belongs to the second half of the
18th century, and was taken from the church of St. Pierre-le-Vieil.</p>

<h4>The Choir of St. Remi Church</h4>

<p>The Choir was rebuilt by Pierre de Celle. The plan is very like that of the
choir of the Cathedral, of which it is the prototype.</p>

<p>As in the Cathedral, it intrudes upon the nave, of which it occupies the
three last bays. In the latter, the columns placed against the six piers were
removed. The groups of small columns which support the ribs of the vaulting
rest upon a corbel-table carried by three consoles (<i>photo above</i>), which in turn
rest on colonnettes with crocketed capitals. The central consoles are ornamented
with figures of angels and symbolic animals, while under the lateral
consoles are statuettes of prophets holding scrolls, on which their names are
inscribed in painted letters.</p>

<p>Five circular radiating chapels open out on the vast ambulatory. The
plan of the latter, like that of Nôtre-Dame-de-Châlons, evokes all that is most
original in the Gothic architecture of Champagne. The bays with their
alternations of square-ogival and triangular vaulting do not correspond
with the breadth of the radiating chapels, which are connected to one another
by three arcades resting on light columns. In the lower nave, from the
curiously large number of points of support, it would seem that the builders
had doubts as to the strength of the pointed style and, by way of precaution,
greatly increased the number of points of support inside the church and of the
exterior buttresses. The tribunes rising above the arcades are surmounted
with a triforium lighted by high windows, which still retain their beautiful
early 18th century stained-glass. The somewhat stiff figures stand out on a
uniformly blue ground. In the upper part, apostles, evangelists, and the
sixteen greater prophets are grouped around a stately Virgin. In the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
part, the principal archbishops of Rheims on thrones are seated round St. Remi
who occupies the place of honour below the Virgin. In the two last windows
are effigies of Archbishops Samson (<i>deceased in 1161</i>) and Henry of France,
during whose episcopate Pierre de Celle caused the apse to be built.</p>

</div>

<p>The choir is surrounded by a Renaissance railing which is out of harmony
with the general scheme. It was erected between 1656 and 1669, at the joint
expense of the widow of the famous barrister Omer Talon, the Town Council,
the Duke of Longueville, and the Grand Prior of St. Remi. The sculptor
François Jacques seems to have co-operated therewith.</p>

<p>The great <i>crown of light</i> hanging at the entrance to the choir was an imitation
of the original crown, destroyed in 1793, and which was garnished with
ninety-six candles, symbolizing the ninety-six years of St. Remi's life (<i>see
p. <a href="#Page_108">108</a></i>).</p>

<p>The 18th century high-altar of red marble which, like the cross and the
six chandeliers, came from the church of the Minims, was crushed beneath
the falling vaulting.</p>

<p>At the time of the Revolution (1792) the chandelier (masterpiece of the
old Rheims metal-founders), which adorned the centre of the Sanctuary,
was broken and melted down, with the exception of a portion of one of the
feet. This fragment (<i>photo above</i>), preserved in the Archæological Museum,
was destroyed by the bombardment of 1914.</p>

<h4>The Tomb and Reliquary of St. Remi</h4>

<p>The present tomb, erected in 1847, is only a memorial of the sumptuous
mausoleum, profusely decorated with gold medals, diamonds and sapphires,
which was destroyed at the time of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It is a Renaissance chapel, ornamented with the statues of the original
tomb, which form by far the most interesting part of the monument. The
twelve Peers are represented in their coronation robes: the Archbishop,
Duke of Rheims, carries the Cross; the Archbishop, Duke of Laon, the sceptre;
the Bishop, Count of Beauvais, the royal mantle; the Bishop, Count of
Châlons, the ring; the Bishop, Count of Noyon, the girdle; the Duke
of Burgundy, the crown; the Duke of Aquitaine, the standard; the Duke of
Normandy, a second standard; the Count of Flanders, the sword; the Count
of Toulouse, the spurs; the Count of Champagne, the military standard of
the King.</p>

<p>The Reliquary of St. Remi, which is in the mausoleum, dates from 1896.
It was bought by national subscription and presented to the church on the
occasion of the centenary of the baptism of Clovis. In the niches of the lower
part of the reliquary are statuettes of the twelve apostles. Higher up, in
the recesses of the long sides, enamels illustrating episodes in the life of St. Remi
are imbedded. On the two ends, two enamels represent the Battle of Tolbiac
and the Baptism of Clovis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Leave the Church of St. Remi by the western doorway, which faces the Place
de l'Hôpital civil, cross the square, then turn to the right into the Rue Simon.
The entrance to the</i> Hôtel-Dieu Hospital <i>is on the right</i>.</p>


<h4>The Hôtel-Dieu</h4>

<p>This hospital is installed in the buildings of the ancient Abbey of the
Benedictine monks of St. Remi who, for centuries, were the guardians of the
relics of the famous Bishop of Rheims.</p>

<p>During the invasion, at the time of the Revolution, the Abbey was transformed
into a military hospital, but it was only in 1827 that it became officially
the <i>Hôtel-Dieu,</i> in place of the old Municipal Hospital (<i>see "Palais de Justice"
p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a></i>). The furnishings of the latter were then transferred to the Abbey
buildings, disaffected since the Restoration.</p>

<p>Of the ancient abbey, where <i>Charles-le-Simple</i> and the <i>Duc Robert</i> were
proclaimed king, and where several archbishops were elected, only a few
vestiges remain. Damaged by the fires of 1098, 1481, and 1751, it was completely
destroyed by the great conflagration of January 15, 1774. The
present abbey, rebuilt by Duroche, the King's architect, was scarcely finished
when the Revolution broke out.</p>

<p>Incendiary bombs dropped by German aeroplanes in August, 1916,
destroyed most of the buildings.</p>

<p>The monumental façade which faces the Court of Honour is Louis XVI.
in style.</p>

<p>The second court, that behind the main buildings, is bordered by a cloister
built by the Rheims architect, Nicolas Bonhomme, in the first part of the
18th century, in place of the 13th and 14th century cloister destroyed in 1707.
The buttresses of the side which abuts on the church of St. Remi, and those
of the opposite side, are 12th century.</p>

<p>The marble fountain with bronze furnishings, in the centre of the court,
was formerly in the Place St. Nicaise. It was erected in 1750 from designs
by <i>Coustou</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the back of the court, on the left</i>, is an exceedingly fine Louis XVI.
staircase with wrought-iron handrail (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The <b>Lapidary Museum</b>, which was formerly in the crypt of the archi-episcopal
chapel (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a></i>), was installed under one of the galleries of the
cloister in 1896. Of the tombstones, storied floor-tiles, and various carvings
which it contains, the most remarkable is the <b>Tomb of Jovinus</b>.</p>

<p>Consul in 367, Jovinus commanded the armies in Gaul, under the Emperor
Julian, and successfully resisted three attempts at invasion by the Alemanni.
As a Christian, he founded a basilica at Rheims.</p>

<p>The white marble tomb with carvings is apparently Græco-Roman of
the 3rd century, and dates back before the time of Jovinus, who died in 370.
It is possible that Jovinus had the first occupant of the tomb ejected, or
that he bought an old sarcophagus and had his own portrait affixed to it.</p>

<p>The chapel installed in the old library of the abbey contained some fine
Louis XVI. wood carvings (<i>see photo below of the ruins of the chapel</i>).</p>

<p>The <b>chapter-house</b> of the abbey, which served as a refectory, was rebuilt
about the end of the 12th century. With its pointed arches, it belonged to
the early period of Gothic architecture. The most remarkable portion was
the vestibule facing the cloister. The decoration of the lateral arcades of
the vestibule included Roman capitals, nearly all of which are intact (<i>photo
below</i>), and which are of great value from the standpoint of the history of
art and costumes. In the refectory were the <i>Godard</i> tables made out of a
single branch of a gigantic oak-tree from the forest of St. Basle. They were
given to the old <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> by Canon Godard, whose name is incrusted in
lead in the wood, as a rebus: <i>Go</i>, followed by the figure of a dart (French:
<i>dard</i>).</p>

<p>Near the chapter-house, a round-arched chamber was all that remained
of the early portion of the abbey.</p>

<i>on the right.</i></p>


<h4>The Hôpital Général</h4>

<p>This is the old Order-House of the Jesuits, built at the beginning of the
17th century. The <b>refectory</b> is ornamented with rich woodwork and paintings,
by the Rheims artist Hélart. Of greater interest is the <i>library</i>,
situated under the gables, and which is reached by a fine staircase. The
room is adorned with a profusion of wood-carvings and mouldings. Exceedingly
fine consoles carry the ceiling, whose carved panels are profusely
ornamented with crowns, polygons, florets and heads of angels. The oaken
pilasters which separate the bookshelves are decorated with a variety of
leaves and flowers. In spite of this wealth of ornament, the general effect is
harmonious. The recesses in the woodwork, opposite the dummy dormer-windows,
were for reading.</p>

<p>Ancient vines cover the walls of the chapel, near the entrance to the
<i>hôpital</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the side of the Hôpital Général stands the</i> <b>Church of St. Maurice</b>.</p>

<p>This church was entirely rebuilt by the Jesuits after the destruction of the
ancient edifice, which was one of the oldest in Rheims. Here may be seen
the <i>Eagle Reading-Desk</i>, a fine piece of 17th century wood-carving; two
<i>Louis XIV. portable iron desks</i> and the <i>paschal chandelier</i> of carved wood;
the <i>17th century confessionals</i> of the lateral chapels, and in the sacristy
remarkable <i>Louis XIII., hand-embroidered guipures</i> of open-work designs,

<p>This part of the Itinerary will take the tourist to the most important
points of the last German offensive of 1918, which aimed at the capture of
Rheims.</p>

<p><i>Starting from the Place du Parvis Nôtre-Dame, take the Rue Libergier,
opposite the Cathedral, turn to the right into the Rue Chanzy, follow same as far
as the Rue de Vesle, take the latter on the left, and follow it to the end.</i></p>

<p><i>After the</i> <b>Porte de Paris</b> <i>(see p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>) the Rue de Vesle becomes the Avenue
de Paris. Take same, but after passing under the railway bridge, turn to the
left into the Avenue d'Epernay (R. N. 51, see plan, p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>).</i></p>

<p><i>Take the second street on the right (Rue de Bezannes), which passes in front
of the</i> <b>Western Cemetery</b>, devastated by the bombardments.</p>

<p>The road crosses numerous lines of trenches and boyaux, which defended
the immediate approaches to Rheims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Before reaching Bezannes village, leave on the right, two roads which skirt
a large estate enclosed with railings, go straight on to the ruined railway-station
of Bezannes, then turn to the right.</i></p>


<h4>Bezannes</h4>

<h6>(<i>See Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p><i>Cross the first group of half-ruined houses, then, on reaching a second group,
which forms the main part of the village, turn to the left into the first street
encountered, where the</i> partially destroyed church <i>stands</i>.</p>

<p>The round-vaulted apse, tower, nave and aisles all belong to the
Romanesque period. The Gothic doorway is 13th, and the spire of the
belfry 15th century.</p>

<p>The square tower greatly resembles the old belfry on the doorway of
St. Remi Church in Rheims, and, like the latter, dates apparently from the
middle of the 11th century.</p>

<p>The Gothic doorway of the west front is set up against a Romanesque
wall. The gable has been rebuilt in modern times. Vestiges of an ancient
portal are to be found on each side of the doorway. The key-stones of the
arch above the tympanum, like those of the upper arching, are numbered in
Roman figures, a peculiarity rarely to be found.</p>

<p>Facing the doorway of the church, on the left of the great entrance-door
to a court, is a niche containing a 16th century stone <b>statue</b> representing a
bishop wearing a chasuble.</p>

<p>In the court of the same house, over the door of the main structure, on
the right, in an arched Renaissance niche, hollowed out and ornamented
with marble incrustations, is the <b>statue</b> of a canon with folded hands
kneeling at the foot of a crucifixion.</p>

<p>A shell-splinter took off the
head of the bishop's statue, but
the other group is intact.</p>

<p>Those interested in things pre-historic,
may visit the <b>Pistat
Collection</b> at Bezannes, which contains
a great number of interesting
specimens belonging to the stone
and neolithic ages, and to the
Gallic and Roman periods of the
region.</p>

<p>Of the old castles of Bezannes,
nothing of interest remains.</p>

<p>On September 11, 1914, during
the Battle of the Marne, the
German Staff took up their quarters
in the house of M. Poullot.
On the 12th, the battle attained
the vicinity of the village.</p>

<p><i>Skirt the church, and at the
cross-roads at the end of the village,
keep straight on, past the cemetery on
the right.</i></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The road climbs a small hill lined with trenches, then descends to the village of</i>
<b>Les Mesneux</b>.</p>

<p><i>At the entrance to this village (which is of no particular interest) turn to
the right, and at the fork about fifty yards farther on, to the left, leaving the
unmetalled road on the right.</i></p>

<p><i>About half-a-mile from Les Mesneux and shortly before reaching the crossing
with the road to Rheims (G. C. 6)</i>, there is a small wood at the place called
<b>Le Champ Clairon</b>. It was from here that German batteries under Colonel
von Roeder fired on Rheims on September 4, 1914, in spite of the protestations
of the Mayor of Les Mesneux, who assured the German commander
that the French troops had completely evacuated the town.</p>

<p><i>At the crossing with G. C. 6, keep straight on to Ormes</i>, whose church, at the
entrance to the village, was almost entirely destroyed.</p>


<h4>Ormes</h4>

<h6>(<i>See Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>This village, in addition to numerous subterranean passages and chambers,
possesses the interesting 12th century <b>Church St. Remi</b> (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>Its circular apse with cornice resting on corbels is barrel-vaulted. Colonnettes
in the great bays of the steeple (in ruins) carry carved 12th century
capitals.</p>

<p>The pointed vaulting of the southern transept is 12th century, and the
ogival groining rests on Norman capitals. The doorway of the western
façade dates from the second half of the 12th century, and although its porch
was destroyed in 1853 it is still remarkable.</p>

<p>It comprises three tierce-pointed arcades surmounted by a line of billet-moulding.
The lateral arcades are blind, while the higher central arcading
around the door is surmounted with three receding <i>tori</i> resting on crocketed
foliate capitals. The lateral arcades have similar capitals but only one
<i>torus</i>.</p>

<p>Inside the church are interesting <b>16th century statues</b>: <i>St. Barbara</i>
in stone and <i>St. Catharine</i>, painted and decorated, face the altar; <i>St. Remi</i>
in stone, remarkable for its costume and decoration, stands above the altar
of the northern chapel; a wooden <i>Virgin</i> surmounts the inner doorway.</p>

<p><i>Return by the same road to the crossing with the road to Rheims (G. C. 6),
where, opposite the</i> <b>Café du Joyeux Laboureur</b>, <i>turn to the right.</i></p>

<p>The road rises towards the Mountain of Rheims. Of the <i>camouflaging</i>
seen in above photograph, only traces remain.</p>

<p><i>Shortly after, the tourist passes between the villages of</i> <b>Jouy</b> <i>and</i> <b>Pargny</b>,
<i>whose houses border the road.</i> Jouy (<i>on the left</i>) and Pargny (<i>on the right</i>) were
bombarded by the Germans in June, 1915.</p>

<p>The <b>Church of Jouy</b>, visible from the road to Rheims, was almost
entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><i>To visit the church of Pargny, turn to the right opposite the grocery stores,
No. 262, then take the second street on the left</i> (near a fine mansion partly in
ruins).</p>

<p><i>About 100 yards farther on is</i> the church, the belfry of which was destroyed.
<i>Return to the crossing with the main road to Rheims, where turn to the right.</i></p>

<p>The road continues to climb the northern slopes of the Mountain of Rheims.
On a hill to the left, the <b>Chapel of St. Lié</b> dominates the surrounding plain.
There is a very fine view of Rheims from here.</p>

<p><i>The top of the rise is reached soon afterwards. Descend the southern slopes,
passing between the sidings of an</i> important material and ammunition depot
situated on the reverse side of the mountain out of sight of the enemy's
observation-posts. <i>On reaching the crossing half-way down the hill, leave on
the left the two roads leading respectively to</i> <b>Ville Dommange</b> <i>and</i> <b>Courmas</b>.</p>

<p><i>A short distance further on, after passing the road to Onrézy (on the left),
take the following narrow road on the left</i>, which passes between clumps of trees
that were cut to pieces by shell-fire.</p>

<p><i>A little further on, on the right, is a</i> cemetery containing the graves of some
two hundred French, British and Italian soldiers.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the right after the cemetery.</i> The road crosses a fine avenue bordered
with shell-torn poplar trees, leading to the <b>Castle of Commetreuil</b> <i>on the
left</i>. <i>The village of</i> <b>Bouilly</b> is reached soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Bouilly was burnt by the Germans on September 12, 1914, under the
pretext that the inhabitants had caused the death of two <i>Uhlans</i> killed the
day before by French <i>Chasseurs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the right opposite the Church of Bouilly.</i> There is a small cemetery
on the right, just outside the village, containing several German graves.</p>

<p><i>On reaching G.C. 6, leading to Rheims, turn to the right. Take the first
road on the left</i>, which passes through a small devastated wood, where batteries
of guns were posted. <i>Cross a small stream, and immediately afterwards the
railway, then turn to the left into the village of</i> <b>St. Euphraise</b>.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the right in the village, opposite the church.</i> The road rises steeply
to the hamlet of <b>Clairizet</b>, which was almost entirely destroyed. <i>Pass by

<p>Gueux is a small old-world village, with ancient houses, castle and church.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the village, a large square with trees, cut to pieces and
devastated by the bombardment.</p>

<p><i>From the square, go to the</i> <b>Church</b> <i>on the right</i>, now a heap of ruins. Seen
through the trees from the square it forms a pitiful sight.</p>

<p>In the chapel, on the left of the main entrance, there was a fine piece of
Renaissance carving.</p>

<p>It was to Gueux that the Archbishop of Rheims, Mgr. Luçon, betook
himself after the bombardments of April, 1917. The village cemetery contains

<p>This ancient castle, where the Kings of France, on their way to Rheims to

<h4>Thillois</h4>

<h6>(<i>See Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>The <b>Church of Thillois</b> (late 12th century), now a heap of ruins, stood
at the entrance to the village.</p>

<p>In 1914 it was still intact in all its vital parts. Its vaulting was pointed,
with groining resting on columns, whose capitals were either Romanesque
or Gothic. The nave had a timber roof.</p>

<p>The high-altar screen was a fine piece of sculptured stone-work of late
16th or early 17th century. In a niche above the altar, the Virgin, sitting on
an X-shaped seat, was holding Jesus, clothed in a tunic and standing on her
knee.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the church behind on the right, turn to the left, to reach the National
Road. On the right is a</i> small 18th century castle, behind a clump of fine stately
trees, known as the <i>Bosquet de Thillois</i>. It was destroyed by shells.</p>

<p><i>Return to the National Road, turn to the right at the cross-roads, leaving on
the left the road to Champigny, then return direct to Rheims, entering the city by

<h4>The Mountain of Rheims Battles</h4>

<h6>(<i>See p. <a href="#Page_14">14</a> and p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>The fighting known as the <i>Battles of the Mountain of Rheims</i> took place in
1918 over the whole of the area described above, <i>i.e.</i> from Bouilly to Thillois,
<i>via</i> St. Euphraise, Coulommes, Vrigny and Gueux (<i>see the Michelin Illustrated
Guide: The Second Battle of the Marne</i>).</p>

<p>The Mountain of Rheims prolongs the region of Tardenois to the east.
It is an important military position between the Vesle and the Marne, as it
dominates the plain of Champagne. The higher part of it is finely wooded,
while on the lower slopes and eastern and southern edges are the famous
Champagne vineyards (<i>see Verzenay, pp. <a href="#Page_171">171</a>-<a href="#Page_172">172</a></i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<img src="images/i140.png" width="700" height="634" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>During the year 1918 the Germans made tremendous efforts to carry this
position, the loss of which would have meant the fall of Rheims, leaving
Epernay and Châlons-sur-Marne unprotected.</p>

<p>Although held to the east of Mountain, they obtained important successes
on the west, where they reached the Marne, while in May they occupied the
Woods of Courton and Le Roi. In July they crossed the Marne and advanced
as far as Montvoisin, on the road to Epernay. Very fierce fighting took place,
especially to the north-west of the Mountain at <b>Bouilly</b>, <b>Bligny</b>,
<b>St. Euphraise</b> and <b>Vrigny</b>. These positions, and Hill 240 to the west of
Vrigny, were several times lost and recaptured by the Allied troops under
General Berthelot, French, Italian and British, who fought there side by side.</p>

<p>Vrigny was taken by the Germans on May 30, but retaken by the Allies
on June 1 at the point of the bayonet. The same evening, four German
regiments, after progressing slightly in the direction of Hill 240, were first
checked, then driven back after bitter hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>On June 9, the Germans were repulsed around Vrigny, after having sustained
severe losses. On the 23rd, they rushed Bligny Hill, held by Italian
troops, reaching the summit, but were shortly afterwards driven back. On
the 29th, they sustained a like check at the same place.</p>

<p>In July they advanced their lines slightly towards Marfaux, Pourcy and
Cuchery, but were unable to hold the captured ground. On the 18th, the
Italians advanced in the region of Bouilly. On the 19th, Franco-British
troops progressed towards St. Euphraise. On the 21st, the Allies carried
Bouilly and St. Euphraise. On the 24th and 25th, in spite of desperate
repeated efforts, the Germans were unable to hold Hill 240 which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
temporarily captured. On August 1 further enemy efforts to carry the
Bligny uplands failed.</p>

<p>The region of Gueux&mdash;Thillois&mdash;Champigny was terribly ravaged by
the war.</p>

<p>On September 11th, 1914, the French 5th Division, under General Mangin,
drove the enemy from these positions, which remained in the French lines
until May 30, 1918. Occupied by the Germans on May 31, after fierce
fighting, they were completely devastated by artillery fire. Retaken by the
French, then lost again in July, Thillois was finally recaptured on August 2,
at the same time as Gueux.</p>

<p>On August 4, after having reached the Vesle at several points east of
Fismes, French troops engaged a vigorous battle between Muizon and
Champigny, and some of them succeeded in crossing the river the same day.</p>


<h4>Champagne Wine</h4>

<p>Wine-growing has always been a favourite industry in this part of France.
The vineyards extend over the Rheims hills and along the valley of the Marne.
In the hilly country around Rheims there are two distinct growths of wine:
the <i>Montagne</i> proper, with its famous <i>Verzy</i>, <i>Verzenay</i>, <i>Mailly</i>, <i>Ludes</i>, <i>Rilly</i>
and <i>Villers</i> "crus," and the <i>Petite Montagne</i> with its secondary "crus" of
the <i>Tardenois Valley</i>, <i>Hermonville Hills</i>, <i>St. Thierry</i>, <i>Nogent l'Abbesse</i> and
<i>Cernay-les-Reims</i>. The <i>Montagne</i> produces more especially black grapes for
white wines.</p>

<p>Champagne wines were famous as far back as the 16th and 17th centuries.
Henri IV. had a marked preference for the wines of <i>Ay</i>. The magnitude of
the cellars still to be seen in the 16th and 17th century houses testifies to the
importance of a trade, whose main outlets were Paris, Flanders, Belgium and
Germany.</p>

<p>The Champagne wines of that period were red, and rivals of the famous
Burgundy wines.</p>

<p>The vogue of Champagne wines as understood to-day dates back to the
end of the 17th century. It was Dom Pérignon, cellarer of the Abbey of
Hautevillers, near Epernay, who, if not actually the inventor of sparkling
wines, first undertook to perfect them by blending the "crus" and preparing
them with greater care.</p>

<p>In the last years of the reign of Louis XIV., and still more so under the
Regency, the use of Champagne at Court gained ground, especially at the
tables of the <i>Duc de Vendôme</i> and the <i>Marquis de Sillery</i>.</p>

<p>At that time Champagne was merely a "creamy" wine, <i>i.e.</i> semi-sparkling.
The low breaking strain of the glass of those days would not
have allowed of the higher pressure (six atmospheres) of the present-day
wine. The discovery of the chemist François, who in 1836 at Châlons invented
a special "densimeter," made it possible to calculate the amount of carbonic
acid gas contained in the must, and to proportion the expansive force of the
wine to the strength of the bottles, thus reducing losses by breakage, which
for long had been very serious.</p>

<p>From the 19th century onwards, the production of Champagne wine has
grown unceasingly. The number of bottles of sparkling Champagne placed
on the market for sale in France and abroad rose from 19,145,481 (of which
16,705,719 went abroad) between April, 1875, and April, 1876, to 33,171,395
(of which 23,056,847 went abroad) between April, 1906 and April, 1907. During
the first ten months of 1915, the exports of Champagne and sparkling wines
were 630,140 wine-quarts, as against 1,092,660 wine quarts in 1914.</p>

de Paris (N. 31). Before leaving Rheims the tourist can, if desired, visit</i>
<b>Haubette Park</b>. <i>In this case, turn to the left, opposite No. 10, Avenue
de Paris, into the Rue Flin des Oliviers. The entrance to</i> Haubette Park
(an annex of the Calmette Dispensary) <i>stands at the beginning of this street, on
the right</i>.</p>

<p>Napoleon I. bivouacked in this park while his troops attacked Rheims in
1814. A monument and a small museum commemorate the event. At the
end of 1914 Haubette Park was a favourite recreation ground and refuge
for the inhabitants of the city during the bombardments.</p>

<p><i>Return to the junction of N. 31 (which leads to Fismes) with G. C. 6 (the road
to Ville-en-Tardenois). Take N. 31 on the right. About 1 km. from the fork take

<h4>Tinqueux&mdash;Mont St. Pierre</h4>

<p>The church of Tinqueux (St. Peter's) was entirely destroyed. It contained,
on the left side of the nave, a remarkable 16th century painting on wood,
representing the <i>Adoration of the Shepherds</i>, with a frame of the same
period.</p>

<p><i>Near the church, between the Vesle and the main street of the village</i>, stood an
old baronial mansion, in front of which was a building with turreted façade
known as the <b>Maison de la Salle</b>. Inside the buildings which, in later
years, served as a farm, there was a curious old wooden staircase with railed
balustrade. The whole was destroyed by the shells.</p>

<p>In September, 1914, at the beginning of the bombardment of Rheims,
many of the people took refuge at Tinqueux.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Brice was almost entirely destroyed. In style, it is

front contains interesting carvings&mdash;unhappily much mutilated.</p>

<p><i>Return by the same way to the cross-roads in front of the bridge over the Vesle,
turn to the right, then, about 150 yards further on, to the left. Continue straight
ahead, cross the railway (l.c.) and follow the railway on the left.</i></p>

<p><i>About half a mile further on an avenue on the right leads to the</i> <b>Château
de la Malle</b>. Both the castle and grounds were badly damaged by the
bombardment.</p>

<p>Standing in the park with magnificent avenues of beech-trees, the castle
is one of the most ancient manors in the vicinity of Rheims. It was rebuilt
in one storey at the beginning of the 14th century on the old foundations.
The decoration of the interior (Louis XVI.) is interesting. The drawing-room
has retained its old wainscoting and paintings. A carved shield bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the arms of the Cauchon family, a member of which, the Bishop of Beauvais,
sided with the English and the Duke of Burgundy against the Dauphin of
France and Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years' War, is still to be seen
over a door of one of the out-buildings.</p>

<p><i>Return by the same road to the Vesle. Cross the river and follow it (as per

<h6>(<i>See Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>, summary of the Military Operations, p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p>This village was frequently bombarded by the Germans from 1914 to
1918. <i>It is crossed by a narrow, winding street containing several sharp turnings.
Shortly before the end of the village, the street widens abruptly. About a hundred
yards further on is the church, while on the right a monumental door gives access</i>
to the <b>Château of St. Thierry</b> (<i>photos, p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a></i>).</p>

<p>This castle was built in 1777 by Mgr. de Talleyrand-Périgord, Archbishop
of Rheims. It replaced the ancient abbey founded in the 6th century by
St. Thierry, a disciple of St. Remi. Remains of the 12th century chapter-house
ogives, colonnettes and capitals, as well as an old chimney-piece,
have been rebuilt into the kitchens. The spacious Louis XVI. drawing-room
and the dining-room were likewise remarkable.</p>

<p>The church (<i>see photos above and on p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a></i>) possessed certain remarkable
features, <i>e.g.</i> the porch, nave and organ-loft. The 12th century porch had a
17th century pent-house roof.</p>

<p>Inside the church were Gothic stalls, and a 16th century bas-relief depicting
<i>The Martyrdom of St. Quentin</i>.</p>

<p>The church is now in ruins.</p>

<p><i>Opposite the castle gate turn to the left into G.C. 26.</i></p>

<p>In the embankments along the road are numerous shelters, posts of commandment,
ammunition depots, etc.</p>

<p>The church, entirely in ruins, <i>stands at the end of the village, on a small
eminence to the right</i>.</p>

<p><i>Half-way through the village, on the left, is a road which leads to the St.
Thierry Fort, via the village of Pouillon.</i></p>

<p>The road from Thil to Cormicy was the starting-point of the communicating
trenches which led to the first lines along the National Road No. <b>44</b> and
along the canal from the Aisne to the Marne, during the long stabilisation
period of the Berry-au-Bac&mdash;Rheims front. All along the road can still be
seen, practically intact, the military works which were in the immediate
rear of the front lines, viz., posts of commandment, depots, shelters, etc.
At the present time, close to the destroyed villages, these shelters are being
used by the people as habitations.</p>

<p><i>Beyond Thil, the road passes between two embankments.</i> <b>Villers-Franqueux</b>

<h4>Hermonville</h4>

<p><i>Follow the rails, straight ahead, to</i> Hermonville.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the left, at the entrance to the village, into the large square, on the
opposite side of which stands the</i> <b>Town Hall</b>, partially destroyed. The
<b>Church</b> <i>is on the right</i>.</p>

<p>This remarkable church is 12th century. The pointed vaulting of the
nave was raised in 1870, but this had been provided for in the original plans.
At the intersection of the transept the pointed vaulting is lower. The capitals
with their finely carved palm-leaves appear to be rather more recent than
those of the nave, and extend frieze-like round the pillars. The bays of the
transept-arms and of the two square eastern chapels are round-arched and
surmounted with a quatrefoil&mdash;an arrangement frequently met with in the
vicinity of Rheims.</p>

<p>The outer porch, like that of Cauroy-les-Hermonville and St. Thierry,
is a 12th century addition. The depressed arch of the entrance is 17th
century.</p>

<p>The square tower at the corner of the nave and south transept has cubic
capitals in the twin bays of the second storey.</p>

<p>The ancient <b>cemetery</b>, which used to surround the church, is bordered
by old houses. Entrance was gained by a little gate facing the porch, in
which are incrusted fragments of a 15th century altar-screen representing a
horseman and a group of persons.</p>

<p>The village was frequently bombarded by the Germans after the Battle
of the Marne. In 1916 several inhabitants were killed by shells.</p>

<p><i>Leave the church on the right, and follow the Rue Sébastopol, at the end of
which is an abrupt turning to the left. The road skirts a large house and garden
surrounded by a wall. At the end of the latter, turn to the right into the Rue
de Sommerville. On leaving the village, turn to the left, then go straight on to</i>

<p><i>Turn to the right at the entrance to the village, then into the first street on the

<p>This Church (<i>historical monument</i>) has an original 12th century porch,
which was mutilated by the bombardments.</p>

<p>Romanesque in style, it stands out from the remainder of the building
and extends over the whole breadth of the west front. Its tile-covered roof
rests on a timber-work frame, whose beams appear to be 16th century. Two
round-arched openings in the ends of the porch serve as entrances. The
front is pierced with a number of round arcades. The central door giving
access to the church is of a later date (16th or 17th century). The capitals
of the arcadings are 12th century. Their curious decoration represents
figures of men, animals, birds, scrolls, etc.</p>

<p>The ruined tower and nave were likewise 12th century. The side-chapels,
transept-crossing and choir were rebuilt in the 16th century.</p>

<p>In the interior of the church, the wooden altar-screen over the high-altar
dated from 1616. The painting which decorated its central panel, and the
side woodwork of the choir were removed in 1888. The altar-screen (1547)
of the southern side-chapel was composed of an assemblage of stone statues
representing <i>The Virgin carrying Jesus, St. Roch, a pilgrim</i>, and <i>St. Stephen,
a deacon, with the donor kneeling at his feet</i>.</p>

<p>Under several of the houses in the village are subterranean passages, the
most noteworthy being that under the old presbytery on the left of the
church, to which access is gained by a stair of fifty-one steps.</p>

<p><i>Leave the village of Cauroy by the street (photo, p. <a href="#Page_145">145</a>) which opens up
opposite the church.</i></p>

<p><i>The road passes through clumps of</i> devastated trees. <i>On the left side of
the road is</i> a cemetery, containing numerous well-organised shelters. <i>The

<p><i>Turn to the right at the entrance to the village. On either side are</i> tree-lined
boulevards, which were made on the ancient ramparts. The trees have been
cut to pieces by the shells.</p>

<p>Cormicy was formerly a small fortified town with turret, gates, ramparts
and moats, all of which have disappeared except one gate. The site was
planted with trees, which surround practically the whole town. The town
was destroyed in the time of Charles VI., during the Hundred Years'
War.</p>

<p>The present village suffered severely during the German bombardments,
most of the houses being damaged. In June, 1916, only eighty-three
inhabitants remained in their homes.</p>

<p>The ancient <b>Church</b> was likewise badly damaged (<i>photos above and below</i>).
While the tower, west front, and the two first bays of the nave are late 15th
or early 16th century, the greater part of the nave is 11th or 12th century.
The chevet and the transept-crossing are early 13th century, while the transept
ends probably date from the middle of 12th century.</p>

<p>The portal comprises twin doors surmounted with a broad flamboyant
recess. The doors have been partially mutilated. Above the window
runs a balcony, the Gothic balustrade of which, known as the <i>Gloria Gallery</i>,
was modern. This balustrade was destroyed by the bombardments, which
also brought down the steeple.</p>

<p>The west front has two Gothic doors with 16th century iron-work, at the
extremity of the aisles. The tympana of these doors, formerly lighted,
have been bricked up. The lintels have three consoles ornamented with
fantastic animals and banderoles. The three statues which carried the
consoles have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>In the south transept, on the left, behind the altar, is an interesting small
door surmounted with a square lintel of the 11th or 12th century. Two
figures of winged monsters with heads of a man and a woman and fish tails,
stand out in high relief, framed and separated by a belt, on which are carved
<i>florets</i> mingled with fantastic figures.</p>

<p>The three remarkable 18th century marble altars of the choir and transept
chapels come from the Church of the Nuns of Longueau, the abbey of which,
in the Rue du Jard at Rheims, was sold in 1790. The high-altar occupies
nearly the whole of the chancel. Over the tomb, six columns of grey Dinant
marble, crowned with Corinthian capitals, support an oval marble cornice
with richly carved and gilt consoles of wood. The very large, white and gilt
tabernacle is a fine example of 17th or 18th century woodwork. Its door,
decorated with symbolic attributes, is surrounded by statuettes depicting,
<i>in the lower part</i>, St. John the Evangelist and a holy woman wearing
crowns; <i>above each of these figures</i>, an angel; <i>at the top</i>, The Resurrection
of Christ.</p>

<p>The sixteen carved oak stalls of the choir, as well as the wrought-iron
reading-desk on a marble pedestal, also came from the former Abbey of
Longueau.</p>

<p>Near the choir, on a pillar of the nave, is an inscription to the effect that
the chronicler <i>Flodoard</i>, who died in 966, was <i>Curé</i> of Cormicy.</p>

<p>The modern <b>Town Hall</b>, built by the Rheims architect, Gosset the elder,
which faced the church, was entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>All the places visited since leaving Merfy, <i>i.e.</i> St. Thierry, Thil, Villers-Franqueux,
Hermonville and Cormicy, border the St. Thierry Heights.
The latter are commanded by the fort of the same name and the Chenay
Redoubt, with altitudes of about 670 and 620 feet respectively. They were
recaptured from the Germans after the Battle of the Marne on September 11,
1914, by the French 3rd Corps.</p>

from Rheims to Soissons and the road from Rheims to Laon, remained the
sole protection of Rheims to the north-west.</p>

<p>It was defended by the French 45th Infantry Division (General Naulin),
composed of Algerian Sharp-shooters, Zouaves and African Light Infantry,
who held their ground on May 27-28, after which they were reinforced
by battalions of Singalese and Marines drawn from the sector east of
Rheims.</p>

<p>The struggle was a fierce one, and hand-to-hand fighting frequent. Finally
the constant inflow of German reserves forced back the French who, on May
29, had to abandon the position, to which the enemy afterwards clung for
four months. On October 1 the Germans, beaten on the previous evening
by the French 5th Army on the high ground between the Aisne and Rheims,
was forced to retreat. The French regained possession of Merfy and St.
Thierry, and advanced as far as the outskirts of the Fort of St. Thierry,
which, with Thil and Villers-Franqueux, Hermonville, Courcy and Cormicy,
fell into their hands in the course of the next few days (<i>see map above</i>).</p>

<p><b>Le Godat</b>, formerly a small fief with a castle and chapel (destroyed during
the Revolution in 1793), was merely a farm and a plain country house when
the war broke out. By reason of its position, north of the Aisne Canal,
this bridgehead was, throughout the war, one of the most fiercely disputed
points in the sector north-west of Rheims, even during the period of trench-warfare.
At the time of the French offensive of April, 1917, the 44th Infantry
Regiment advanced beyond Le Godat, where the French held their ground
until the powerful German push of May 27, 1918.</p>

<p>Loivre and its glass-works were occupied in September, 1914, by the Germans,
who deported the inhabitants to the Ardennes. The village and works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were re-captured during the offensive of April 16, 1917, by the French 23rd
and 133rd Infantry Regiments, surnamed <i>Les Braves</i> and <i>Les Lions</i> respectively.
Whilst other battalions outflanked the village and crossed the canal,
the third battalion of <i>Lions</i> attacked it in front. The position, powerfully
organised, was stoutly defended. The attacking troops were obliged to come
to a halt in front of the cemetery (a veritable bastion with concrete casemates),
and before the ruins of the mill, both of which bristled with machine-guns.
Withdrawing slightly to allow of a barrage of 75's, they rushed forward again
under the protection of the latter. The site of the mill and the cemetery
were captured, together with numerous prisoners (122 were taken in one
machine-gun shelter). The ruined village was next carried in a bayonet
charge, to the sound of the bugles. The captures were considerable, one
battalion of 500 men alone taking 825 prisoners.</p>

<p>In March and May, 1918, two violent attacks were made on Loivre by the
Germans, but without success. They took it on May 27, only to be driven
out on October 4.</p>

<p><i>Before the war, a road</i>, which has since completely disappeared, <i>led direct
from Loivre to Brimont. To reach the latter it is now necessary to go farther

<p>Situated to the west of the road from Rheims to Neufchâtel (formerly a
Roman causeway which crossed the hill at <i>Cran de Brimont</i>) Brimont was
already important in Roman times. It was fortified in the Middle Ages,
and traces of its ancient fortifications are still to be found on the hill. The
discovery of a Roman tomb in 1790 caused considerable excitement in archæological
circles, as it was believed to be the burial-place of the Frankish Chief
<i>Pharamond</i> who, according to one chronicler, had been buried on a hillock
near Rheims.</p>

<p>In 1339, during the siege of Rheims by the English, the Duke of Lancaster
had his camp at Brimont.</p>

<p>On several occasions, since September, 1914, the Germans deported the
inhabitants of Brimont and Coucy to the Ardennes. The village is now
destroyed and its church a heap of ruins.</p>

<p>The church was built at the beginning of the 15th century.</p>

<p>The four last bays of the nave, which was partly Romanesque, were
altered in the middle of the 16th century.</p>

<p>The sacristy occupied the lower storey of the square, pointed-arch tower.</p>

<p>Several ancient statues were placed at the entrance to the Choir: <i>St
Remi</i>, with a woman in late 15th century dress kneeling at his feet; a <i>Virgin</i>
offering grapes to the Infant Jesus in her arms (late 15th century) and a
large <i>Christ Crucified</i>, dated from the middle of the 16th century. A beautiful
18th century <i>lectern</i> of carved wood, representing an eagle standing on a
massive three-sided pedestal of red and white marble, stood in front of the
Choir.</p>

<p><b>The Defences North of Rheims and the Fighting
in that Sector</b></p>

<p>The <b>Fort of Brimont</b>, completed by the <b>Battery of the Cran de
Brimont</b> about a mile to the east, and on the west by the <b>Loivre Battery</b>,
mentioned on page <a href="#Page_151">151</a>, sweeps the whole country north of Rheims as far as
the banks of the Aisne, Suippe, Retourne and the Aisne-Marne canal, the
Rheims-Neufchâtel, Rheims-Vouziers, Rheims-Rethel and Rheims-Laon
roads, and the Rheims-Laon and Rheims-Charleville railways. About
five miles east of Brimont and four miles east of Rheims is the position of
<b>Berru</b> (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a></i>), extending along a front of about six miles, <i>via</i> the hills
of Berru and Nogent l'Abbesse. Intended by those who planned it to guard
the valley of the Suippe, the Rheims-Rethe and Rheims-Vouziers roads,
as well as the Rheims-Charleville and Rheims-Châlons-sur-Marne railways,
it comprises the <b>Fort of Witry</b> (about 150 feet in altitude), the batteries of
<b>La Vigie de Berru</b> (870 feet), and the <b>fort and batteries of Nogent-l'Abbesse</b>
(670 feet).</p>

<p>Brimont and Berru are further covered and linked up by the <b>Fort of
Fresne</b> (360 feet), situated four miles north-east of Rheims.</p>

<p>These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> defensive works, conceived and executed after the war of 1870, had,
in consequence of the evolution of strategical and tactical doctrines, been
abandoned or disarmed before the war of 1914. After evacuating Rheims
on September 12, 1914, the Germans grasped the importance of these
works, to which they clung tenaciously, after hurriedly organising them. It
was against these naturally strong positions, further strengthened by trenches,
that the French 5th Army, in pursuit of the enemy, found themselves brought
to a standstill on the evening of September 12. From September 13 to
18, the French tried in vain to capture them. The 5th Division, under
General Mangin, did succeed in capturing the <b>Château de Brimont</b>, in the
plain, but were unable to hold it.</p>

<p>Later, the Germans converted these hills into one of the most formidable
positions organised by them in France. Brimont, Berru, Fresne and Nogent
l'Abbesse, whose guns slowly destroyed Rheims, were, so to speak, her jailers
for four years.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, during the French offensive of the Aisne, one division,
known as the "Division of aces" (because its four regiments have the
fourragère decoration), penetrated into Berméricourt and advanced to the
outskirts of Brimont, but was unable to hold its ground against the furious
counter-attacks of the Germans. It was only in October, 1918, that the
French 5th Army, in conjunction with the victorious attacks of the 4th Army
in Champagne, after forcing the Germans back to the Aisne and the canal,
and after crossing the Aisne canal on October 4 in front of Loivre and
near Berméricourt, forced the enemy, whose communications were now
threatened, to abandon one of the most valuable portions of his 1914 positions.
On October 5, the French re-entered Brimont and Nogent l'Abbesse,
progressed beyond Bourgogne, Cernay-les-Rheims, Beine, Caurel and
Pomacle, and, in spite of desperate enemy resistance, drove back the
Germans to the Suippe.</p>

<p><i>After visiting the fort return to the village of Brimont.</i></p>

<p>From here the <b>Château de Brimont</b> may be visited, but this will have to be
done on foot as the road has been destroyed, traces only of it being left in
places (<i>the lower photograph on p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a> shows the beginning of the road in the
village</i>).</p>

<p>The <b>Château de l'Ermitage</b>, also known as the Château de Brimont, <i>is
situated about 500 yards south of the village, at the entrance to a</i> large park,
completely devastated. It was the scene of desperate fighting (<i>see p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a></i>).</p>

<p><i>Return to Brimont, cross the village (skirting the church) and continue straight
on to the</i> <b>Cran de Brimont Redoubt</b> <i>on the road to Rheims.</i> Numerous
German trenches, etc., are to be seen here.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the right into G.C. 9, which dips down to the</i> Plain of Rheims. The
region hereabouts bristle with barbed-wire entanglements and is crossed with
numerous trenches. It was ranged to an incredible degree by the bombardments.</p>

<p><i>At the bottom of the hill which starts at the Cran de Brimont, cross Soulains
Wood, of which only</i> a few torn tree-stumps remain.</p>

<p><i>Several hundred yards after leaving the wood, take on foot the broken road
to the</i> "<b>Cavaliers de Courcy</b>," situated <i>on the right, about 500 yards
further on.</i></p>

<span class="caption">THE AISNE CANAL AT THE &quot;CAVALIERS DE COURCY&quot;</span>
</div>

<h4>The "Cavaliers de Courcy"</h4>

<p>To the north of La Neuvillette, the Aisne-Marne Canal is flanked on
both sides by enormous artificial embankments planted with fir-trees and
known as the "<b>Cavaliers de Courcy</b>." After their retreat in September, 1914,
the Germans entrenched themselves there and clung to the east bank until
April, 1917.</p>

<p>On April 16, 1917, the French 410th Regiment of the Line attacked
the enemy's formidable positions there. This Brittany regiment set out
from positions to which they had given names taken from the history of their
country (<i>Quimper Bastion</i>, <i>Auray</i>, <i>Redon Bastion</i>, etc.). On the first day
they carried three successive lines of defences, and advanced about a mile.
On the 17th and 18th they left their zone of action, to ensure the <i>liaison</i> on
their right, and to help a brigade in difficulties on their left. For eight days
they held their positions against powerful enemy counter-attacks, after
having progressed to a depth of two miles and captured more than 400
prisoners, 11 bomb-throwers, and an immense amount of stores.</p>

<p>These positions, like the neighbouring villages, were re-taken by the
Germans in May and June, 1918, and finally by the Allies in October, 1918.</p>

<p><i>Return to the road and follow it towards Rheims. Leave on the left</i> the devastated
<b>Aviation-ground of Champagne</b>&mdash;now in a state of complete
upheaval, due to the terrific shelling it received&mdash;<i>then cross the</i> <b>Plain of
Bétheny</b> (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a></i>).</p>

<p>The Plain of Bétheny was the scene of two important historical events:
in 1901 the Tsar Nicolas II. reviewed a part of the French Army there;
in August, 1909, the Great Aviation Week was inaugurated there, in the
presence of an immense crowd of spectators.</p>

<p>The railway embankment south of Pierquin Farm was fiercely disputed
from September 18, 1914, onwards. Several enemy attacks against it broke
down before the French 75's. During the offensive of May, 1918, the whole
of this region was the scene of desperate fighting. La Neuvillette was taken
on May 30, and Pierquin Farm on the 31st. On August 4, the French,
after crossing the Aisne Canal, advanced to La Neuvillette, where the enemy
made a desperate stand. At the beginning of October they advanced to the
north of La Neuvillette, which the enemy was eventually compelled to
abandon. The last inhabitants had left the locality on July 12, 1916.</p>

<p><i>Follow in the contrary direction the route described in the preceding Itinerary
(p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a> to p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>) as far as the crossing in the Berméricourt-Bourgogne road,
where stood</i> Landau Farm, now entirely in ruins. <i>At this crossing take
G.C. 30 on the right.</i> German camouflaging is still visible on the right-hand
side of the road.</p>


<h4>Bourgogne&mdash;Fresnes</h4>

<p><i>The village of</i> Bourgogne, entirely in ruins, <i>is soon reached</i>.</p>

<p>The village is of very ancient origin. Formerly it was protected by a
belt of moats, now partly filled in, and by earthen ramparts, almost everywhere
levelled. The lines of these moats, planted with rows of elm-trees,
are clearly distinguishable. There is a very extensive view from this original
site.</p>

<p>A portion of the village was burnt by the Germans who, in 1916, destroyed
the belfry of the church with dynamite.</p>

<p>This church (dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul), with its fine Romanesque
tower, was remarkable.</p>

<p>The greater part of it dated from the 12th and 13th centuries. It is
now in ruins (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p><i>Cross straight through the village.</i> Numerous German signs <i>are still to be
seen. At the cross-roads just outside the village, follow the railway, then cross
it near the destroyed railway station of Fresnes. The village of</i> Fresnes <i>is
reached shortly afterwards.</i></p>

<p><i>Turn to the right at the first crossing met with.</i> The church <i>stands about
100 yards away, on the left.</i></p>

<p>Norman in style, the Church of Fresnes comprises a central nave with
aisles and a tower without transept. It dates back to the 12th century, but
was several times extensively altered and restored both in the 18th century
and in recent times.</p>

<p>A small porch of limestone added to the northern aisle, is reached by a
round Norman bay of stone. In the corner of the porch, to the left on entering,
is incrusted a fragment of a small funerary monument of the 16th century.</p>

<span class="caption">RUINED CHURCH OF WITRY-LES-REIMS</span>
</div>

<p>This church was almost entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><i>After turning to the right at the crossing mentioned above, keep straight on.</i></p>

<p>About 2 kilometres from Fresnes the road from that village to Witry-les-Reims
crosses an old Roman causeway, at the side of which, slightly to
the south of Hill 118, the Fort of Fresnes was built in 1878. This fort was
blown up by the Germans during their retreat in 1918. Its ruins are
impressive. In the moats of the fort are German trenches and shelters
extending right up to the walls of the fort.</p>

<p><i>The village of Witry-les-Reims is next reached.</i> It suffered severely from
the numerous bombardments, which its situation near the first lines rendered
inevitable.</p>


<h4>Witry-les-Reims</h4>

<p><i>After crossing the railway (l.c.) at the entrance to the village, keep straight
on.</i> The ruined church <i>is on the left, near the entrance to the village</i>.</p>

<p>Except for one tower, which dates from the 12th century, the church is
modern. The spire was destroyed by the Germans. The belfry, used by
the enemy as an observation-post, was struck by French shells.</p>

<p>Like many of the villages around Rheims, Witry-les-Reims is of Gallo-Roman
origin. More than two hundred Gallic sepulchres and cinerary urns
have been brought to light. The objects thus discovered, including a large
number of vases, now form the <i>Bourin</i> pre-historic collection.</p>

<p><i>After visiting the church keep straight on. At the Mairie</i>, of which only
the front remains standing, <i>turn to the right into the Rue Boucton-Fayréaux.
Follow this street to the Place Gambetta (about 200 yards distant), where turn to
the left.</i> The entrance to "Pommern Tunnel," which connected up the
German rear and front lines (<i>photo, p. <a href="#Page_163">163</a></i>), is in this square.</p>

<p>The German inscriptions in the tunnel have been taken down, and the
entrance blocked up, on account of the roof and walls giving way.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Leaving the Place Gambetta, take the Rheims-Rethel road (N. 51) on the left,
then the first street on the right to the</i> <b>Fort of Witry</b>.</p>

<p><i>Just outside the village the road crosses</i> the old Roman causeway from
Rheims to Trèves, <i>and a little further on passes to the left of the</i> <b>Fort of Witry</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Fort of Witry</b> suffered but little from the bombardments.</p>

<p><i>The road climbs the northern slopes of the</i> Berru Hill, across numerous
German trenches. <i>At the bottom of a short run-down, opposite the village of
Berru, is a crossing of four ways. The road leading to the fort is the one straight
ahead.</i></p>

<p><i>On the right, among the</i> numerous defences, is a German cemetery containing
a monument to the dead, ornamented with somewhat rudimentary
carving and bearing an epitaph dedicated to the memory of the German
soldiers who fell in the battles around Rheims.</p>

<p><i>The road continues up the slopes of Berru Hill, to the right of the way leading
to the</i> auxiliary battery of the fort of <b>Vigie de Berru</b>. <i>The top of the hill is
soon reached</i>, on which the fort, known as the "Vigie de Berru," stands.
This fort was little bombarded, and is practically intact.</p>

<p><b>Berru Hill</b>, on account of its height, its sulphurous and ferruginous
waters, flint quarries, and fertile soil, was inhabited in pre-historic times.
At the summit, a <i>campignien</i> workshop, and farther down, above the springs
which supply the village with water, a neolithic station have been discovered.
Thousands of knives, arrow-heads, scrapers, saws, and other primitive tools
have been unearthed. In the Gallo-Roman times the village must have been
fairly important, judging by the vestiges of the ancient buildings discovered
at the foot of the hill. It was near Berru that the <i>Gaulish helmet</i>, now in the
National Museum of St. Germain, was found. Towards the end of the 16th
century (about 1575), during the Leaguers' struggles around Rheims, the
village was fortified, to protect it from pillaging by the soldiers. The moats
and glacis which surrounded it are still visible to the south, where, covered
with trees, they adjoin the gardens. Subterranean places of refuge, the
entrance to which is no longer known, formerly existed underneath the village.</p>

<p><i>From the fort, the road, winds down the opposite slopes of the hill. At
the bottom of the latter, leave on the right the road to the</i> <b>Fort of Nogent
l'Abbesse,</b> <i>seen on the high ground to the right.</i></p>

<h6>(<i>See Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>, and summary of the Military Operations, p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>.</i>)</h6>

<p><i>The village of</i> <b>Nogent l'Abbesse</b> <i>is next reached, at the entrance to which
the road divides into three branches. Take the middle one (G.C. 64), which leads
to the</i> ruined village of <b>Beine</b>. <i>During the run-down to the village, there is a</i>
fine view of the Champagne Hills in front (Mont Cornillet and Mont Haut).</p>

<p>The village of <b>Beine</b> was one of the oldest demesnes belonging to the
Abbey of St. Remi-de-Reims. It was made into a <i>commune</i> at the end of
the 12th century.</p>

<p>The church of St. Laurent, situated in the centre of the village, was an
excellent specimen of the transition style of the 12th century (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p><i>A road leading to Sillery leaves Beine in a south-westerly direction, but owing
to its bad condition it is impossible to use it for returning to Rheims.</i> The
trenches and shell holes have barely been filled in, and the temporary bridges
over the wider trenches would probably break down under a fairly heavy
car. On the other hand, the huge craters made by the Germans in the course
of their retreat, have only been summarily repaired and are not practicable
for motor-cars. <i>Tourists should therefore return to Nogent l'Abbesse by the road
they came by.</i></p>

<p><i>This Itinerary will take the tourist through two regions of entirely different
characters.</i></p>

<p><i>The first part is devoted to visiting the battlefield south-east of Rheims</i>, which
was the scene of much desperate fighting throughout the war, but especially
in 1918. This region formed the pivot of the French right wing, and remained
firm despite the repeated powerful attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p><i>The second part of the Itinerary leaves the battlefield proper, and conducts the
tourist across</i> the most reputed vine-growing centres of Champagne (Verzenay,
Mailly-Champagne and Ludes), through lovely, picturesque country, which,
although it has somewhat suffered from the bombardments, has nevertheless
retained its pre-war aspect.</p>

<p><i>Leave Rheims by the Avenue de Châlons, continued by N. 44 (see the plan
of Rheims between pp. <a href="#Page_32">32</a> and <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, F. 6 and H. 7).</i></p>

<p>The Avenue de Châlons was well within the first-line defences.</p>

<p>Two communicating trenches run along the footpaths on either side of
the Avenue.</p>

<p><i>Skirt</i> Pommery Park, <i>on the left</i>, completely ravaged by the bombardment
and the network of trenches which cross it.</p>

<p><i>As soon as the last houses of the town have been left behind, the tourist finds
himself</i> in the midst of the battlefield.</p>

<p>The sector, known as "<b>La Butte-de-Tir</b>," situated on the left, below
Cernay and beyond the railway, was the scene of furious fighting throughout
the German occupation of 1914 to 1918 (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p><i>The road crosses the Châlons Railway (l.c.), and goes thence direct to the</i>
<b>Fort of La Pompelle</b>, passing through an inextricable network of trenches
and barbed wire entanglements. The country hereabouts was completely
ravaged by the terrific bombardments, and recalls the devastated regions
around Verdun, near Vaux and Douaumont (<i>see the Michelin Illustrated Guide:
Verdun, and the Battles for its Possession</i>).</p>

<p><b>La Jouissance Farm</b> is next passed. Nothing remains either of it or
of the road, <i>which started from this point towards Cernay, on the left</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Fort of La Pompelle</b>, <i>which is next reached</i>, is now a mere heap of
ruins. The road which led to the fort no longer exists. <i>To visit the ruins
of the fort, tourists will have to follow on foot the narrow-gauge railway which
starts from the road (photo above)</i>.</p>

<p>Tradition has it that St. Timothy came from Asia to convert Rheims,
suffered martyrdom, together with St. Apollinaris and several companions,
on the hill known as <i>La Pompelle</i>, so-called perhaps from the procession
(<i>pompa</i> or <i>pompella</i>) which, in the Middle Ages, used to visit the place of
martyrdom of the saints.</p>

<p>This hill, which rises close to the crossing of the Rheims-St.-Hilaire-le-Grand
and Rheims-Châlons Roads, was fortified after 1870, to flank the position
of Berru on the south.</p>

<p>The road from Rheims to Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand (<i>G.C. 7</i>), which used to
start from the "Alger Inn," at the cross-roads mentioned above, no longer
exists. Like the inn, it was obliterated by the shelling. A huge crater now
occupies the site of the Alger Inn (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p><i>Continue along N. 44. About 1 kilometre from the fort, at a bend in the road</i>,
the shattered remnants of trees of an avenue are visible on the left. Under
the first fir-tree of this avenue, about 20 yards from the national road, is an
armoured machine-gun shelter, almost intact.</p>

<p><i>Cross the railway (l.c.) near the entirely destroyed station of Petit-Sillery.
After passing a ruined château on the left, cross the bridge over the Vesle. At
the fork beyond the bridge, leave N. 44 and take G.C. 8 on the right to</i> <b>Sillery</b>.</p>

<p>This village, renowned for its dry wine, is pleasantly situated on the banks
of the Vesle. Throughout the war, it was quite close to the trenches and was
frequently bombarded. In May, 1916, only some fifty of its inhabitants
remained in the village, which subsequently suffered very severely, especially
in 1918.</p>

<p><i>Take a turn in the village, then follow N. 44 towards Châlons (see Itinerary,

<p>The region of <b>Sillery-Pompelle</b> was the scene of much fierce fighting
throughout the war. After the capture of <b>La Pompelle</b> and the "<b>Alger Inn</b>"
by the French 10th Corps on the night of September 17-18, 1914, the
Germans increased the number of their attacks, with a view to regaining these
important positions.</p>

<p>One of these attacks (that of December 30, 1914) was preceded by the
explosion of a mine at the "Alger Inn," which made a hole 130 feet in diameter
by 55 feet deep (<i>see photo, p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a></i>). After a hand-to-hand fight, the French
drove back the enemy and remained masters of the crater.</p>

<p>In 1918, during their offensives against Rheims, the Germans attacked
several times in this region. On June 1, between <b>Pommery Park</b> (in the
south-eastern outskirts of Rheims) and the north-east of Sillery, they attacked
with eight or nine battalions and fifteen tanks. The garrison of Fort Pompelle,
momentarily encircled, held out until a furious counter-attack by the French
Colonial Infantry relieved it and drove back the assailants. The German
tanks were either captured or destroyed. On the 18th, after an hour's intense
bombardment, the Germans made a fresh attack and secured a footing in
the Northern Cemetery of Rheims and in the north-eastern outskirts of
Sillery, but French counter-attacks drove them out almost immediately.
From July 15 to 17 their attacks on Sillery were likewise repulsed.</p>

<p><i>Continue along N. 44 to the</i> destroyed Espérance Farm <i>(about 2 kilometres
distant), then turn to the right</i>. Numerous military works were made by the
French in the embankments of the Aisne-Marne canal along the left side of
the road.</p>

<p><i>The road rises towards the "Mountain of Rheims."</i> A white tower,
dominating the whole plain, <i>is seen on the left (photo below)</i>.</p>

<p><b>Verzenay</b> <i>is next reached by the Rue de Sillery.</i></p>

<p>It was at <b>Verzenay</b> that, on the evening of September 3, 1914, the
German aeroplane, which had dropped bombs on Rheims the same morning,
was brought down. It has suffered relatively little from the bombardments.</p>

<p><i>To visit the church</i>, which contains the tomb of Saint-Basle (<i>chapel on the
right</i>), <i>take the Rue Gambetta, then the Rue Thiers</i>.</p>

<p><i>After visiting the church, return to the Rue Thiers, at the end of which is the
Rue de Mailly (G.C. 26).</i></p>

<p><i>Take the latter, which, on leaving Verzenay, rises fairly stiffly.</i></p>

<p><i>At the top of the hill, on the right, begins the road leading to</i> <b>Verzenay Mill</b>,
which crowns Hill 227 (<i>see Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>, and photo above</i>).</p>

<p>This mill, whence there is a fine panorama of the plain as far as the hills
of Berru and Moronvilliers, was a military observation-post of the first order
during the siege warfare.</p>

<p><i>It belongs to the champagne-wine firm of Heidsieck Monopole, which allows
tourists to visit it, as also their vineyards in the surrounding country.</i></p>

<p><i>The road dips down to</i> Mailly-Champagne, <i>at the entrance to which village
turn to the right into the Rue Gambetta, then to the left into the Rue de Ludes
(G.C. 26)</i>. The road, cut out of the hillside, is very picturesque as far as Ludes.
In the forest, on the left of the road, are numerous "<i>cendrières</i>," or quarries,
from which volcanic sulphurous cinders, used for improving the vines, are
extracted. Heaps of these valuable cinders (grey, white and black) are
frequently encountered at the side of the road.</p>

<p><b>Ludes</b> <i>is next reached by the Avenue de la Gare</i>.</p>

<p>The region just passed through, including the villages of Verzenay,
Mailly-Champagne and Ludes, as well as Verzy (<i>to the east</i>), and Rilly-la-Montagne
and Villers-Allerand (<i>to the west</i>), are the wine-growing centres of
the "Mountain of Rheims" properly so-called, the black grapes from which
produce the best brands of Champagne. The villages are picturesquely
situated at the edge of the forests which crown the hills, while the vineyards
which cover the slopes of the latter descend to the chalky plain. These
vineyards, divided into tiny plots, the ground of which before the ravages of
the phylloxera cost as much as 93,000 francs per hectare (about 2-1/2 acres),
constitute the principal wealth of the country. Here and there they have
suffered from the war, but this has not prevented the vine-dressers from
cultivating them (often with the help of the soldiers) or from gathering the
grapes, under the continual menace of the German guns.</p>

which were destroyed by shell-fire, the tourist reaches</i> <b>Sillery</b>.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the left into G.C. 8, at the entrance to the village. On the right are
vestiges</i> of a small wood, known as "Zouaves Wood," which was the scene of
many sanguinary fights after its capture by the French in 1914.</p>

<p><i>The tourist next reaches</i> <b>Taissy</b>, whose ruined church <i>is on the right, by the
side of the Vesle (photo, p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>)</i>.</p>

<p>This interesting church is largely Romanesque in style (tower, chevet and
nave). The tabernacle, with altar-piece of carved wood, is Louis XIII. A
fine wrought-iron railing encloses the sanctuary (<i>photo below</i>). The small,
sonorous bell of the belfry is, strange to say, 13th or 14th century.</p>

<p><i>Pass straight through Taissy, then follow the tram-lines.</i> <b>Cormontreuil</b> <i>is
entered by the Rue Victor-Hugo.</i></p>

<p><i>From Cormontreuil, the tourist may return to Rheims either by turning to
the right in the village, beyond the tram station (in this case he will enter Rheims
by the Rue de Cormontreuil which leads to the Place Dieu-Lumière) or by continuing
straight ahead. In the latter case he will cross the Faubourg Fléchambault
by the Rue Ledru-Rollin. At the end of the latter, turn to the right into the Rue
Fléchambault which, after crossing the Vesle and the canal, leads to the Church of
St. Remi.</i></p>

<h2>BEAUTIFUL FRANCE</h2>

<h3>NORMANDY.</h3>


<p>Land of rich pastures and fashionable watering-places,
Normandy may truly be said to have been "favoured by
the gods." Her fertile soil, famous breeds of horses and
cattle, picturesque sites, and renowned sea-bathing coast have
made Normandy one of France's most flourishing provinces.
Numerous splendid monuments evoke in the tourist's mind
reminiscences of a glorious past.</p>

<p>No region has been more lavishly adorned by Nature.
Its mountain landscapes have caused it to be surnamed
"La Petite Suisse." Among the more interesting places
may be mentioned <b>Bagnoles-de-l'Orne</b>, with its famous
mineral-water springs; <b>Rouen</b>, with its celebrated cathedral,
churches of St. Ouen and St. Maclou, Palais-de-Justice, and
port (which the war has transformed into one of the most
important in Europe); <b>Caen</b>&mdash;"Norman Athens"&mdash;with
its Romanesque churches, Renaissance mansions, and ancient
houses; the great cathedrals of <b>Sées</b>, <b>Evreux</b>, <b>Bayeux</b>,
and <b>Coutances</b>; the feudal ruins of <b>Arques</b>, <b>Château-Gaillard</b>
and <b>Falaise</b>; the Abbeys of <b>Jumièges</b> and
<b>St. Wandrille</b>; the mediaeval narrow winding streets of
<b>Lisieux</b>.</p>

<p>Numerous sea-side resorts: <b>Dieppe</b>, <b>St. Valéry</b>,
<b>Fécamp</b>, <b>Entretat</b>, <b>Le Hâvre</b>, and <b>St. Adresse</b>,
<b>Honfleur</b>, <b>Trouville</b>, <b>Deauville</b>, <b>Villers</b>, <b>Houlgate</b>,
<b>Cabourg</b>, <b>Cherbourg</b> and <b>Grandville</b> are too widely
known to call for special mention.</p>

<p>Lastly <b>St. Michael's Mount</b> (surnamed the "Marvel
of the West"), with its extraordinary pyramid of superimposed
Gothic monastery and Churches, built on a rock in
the middle of a deep bay.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
